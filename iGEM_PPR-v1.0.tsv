3709	UiOslo_Norway	PFASeOut	PFAS is a collection of per- and polyfluoroakyl compounds that are water-repellent, which in ski wax gives the skis better gliding properties. The International Ski Federation (FIS) has banned the use of PFAS in ski wax during skiing competitions due to the toxic effects they have on the environment and on the health of ski wax appliers. For this ban to be effective and fair for the athletes, there must be a way to efficiently detect PFAS containing wax during competitions. Currently, there are no functioning test for field-use. To tackle this problem, we are using synthetic biology to develop such a detection device. Our detection method exploit two different genes from bacteria which can recognize PFAS compounds and cleave their C-F bond. The presence of PFAS compounds will be based on detection of released fluoride ions , either colorimetrically or by measuring changes in conductivity.

3710	Manchester	UriGel: Fighting Catheter Acquired Urinary Tract Infections With Engineered Bacteria	Catheterization is required in many hospital patients, and long-term catheterization leads to catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in most patients. Talks with doctors identified there was no system in place to effectively prevent CAUTIs. To address this issue, we designed a hydrogel coating containing engineered bacteria which would sense pathogens and secrete biofilm degrading enzymes, secrete inhibitors of virulent enzymes, express a binding domain to attach to the hydrogel and depend on the urinary tract environment for survival (kill switch). Mathematical modelling of our hydrogel found that our secreted products would efficiently diffuse through the hydrogel. We created a model for our antibiofilm mechanism that can be used by future teams with similar mechanisms. Molecular docking modelling identified a candidate virulent enzyme inhibitor. Finally, a urea- and a sarcosine-responsive promoter were characterised to validate our kill switch mechanism. Overall, we have successfully designed a potential solution to CAUTIs.

3711	HUST-China	Mr.Tony	An increasing number of people prefer perming or dyeing to add to their glamor and vigour, and existing hairdressing market scale in China alone is over 20 billion yuan, and that of overall beauty salon industry scale amounts to 380 billion yuan, according to a recent estimation. However, undesired health consequences brought by harmful chemicals used in perming and dyeing process are undisputable. Therefore, an optimized humanistic device for perming and dyeing based on engineered yeast producing natural pigments and short peptides was designed by HUST-China to tackle with this problem, which can produce enzyme to catalyze natural pigment precursors into natural pigments and express short peptides with abundant sulfhydryl. A xylose responding system was also created to fade the pigments ,straighten the curled hair, and resume the hair to its original state. Corresponding devices such as original fermenter were also designed to put engineered yeast in real life scenarios.

3712	HUST2-China	NANO-AI-Cleaner	As the eighth epidemic, acne plagues billions of people and is becoming one of the most common skin diseases. Abnormal proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes and corresponding immune responses are the main factors causing acne. To target both factors, we engineered probiotic E.coli Nissle 1917 to produce BLP-7 with elastin like peptide(ELP) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antagonist with ELP under infrared induction, followed by in-situ assembly of sphere-like nanostructure NANO-AI-Cleaner through ELP-mediated hydrophobic interaction. ELP showed Intelligent temperature-controlled ability and significant skin-repairing effect while BLP-7 kills P. acnes by punching holes on the membrane surface and TLR2 antagonist blocks NF-kB pathway by competing for binding to acylated lipoproteins on the surface of P. acnes. In this way, our multi-functional nanostructure achieves antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing effects at the same time. We have successfully constructed NANO-AI-Cleaner, providing a convincing and promising treatment strategy for acne.

3713	UIUC_Illinois	apPETite: Engineering the PET degrading enzyme with improved thermostability and degradation rate	Polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, is a plastic abundantly used in packaging and containers. Though PET is the most recycled plastic in the U.S., 3.1 million tons are produced annually and its current recycling rate is only 31%. Traditional remediation methods such as pelleting yield less products for every PET regeneration. Also, the microbial remediation with wild-type PET degrading enzymes (commonly called PETase) cannot be used under many current recycling conditions and has low degradation rates. To generate enzymes with higher degradation rates and thermostability, we developed machine learning algorithms to generate a number of candidate enzyme sequences. These candidate enzymes were then expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 and tested for the improved degradation of PET plastic using the NanoDrop method for validation. Project apPETite is an attempt to provide a framework for developing an enzyme with enhanced PET plastic degradation.

3714	SJTU-BioX-Shanghai	Detection Blitz	We live in a world where monstrous industries operate ruthlessly, while the environment is crowded by numerous unknown hazardous bacteria and virus. Emergencies could occur without anyone foreseeing——by then, a lightning fast detection tool would play a vital role. SJTU-BioX-Shanghai think out of the box, constructing a platform that enables the automatic development of new fast detection test strips. With the help of an in vitro evolution strategy for aptazyme, we can effectively find biosensors for wide-ranging targets. Then two rational designed probes are introduced by our prediction model, which enables our nanogold based lateral flow system to show a positive signal with targets in existence. By virtue of the extremely short development cycle and equipment-free final products, our project possesses a bright prospect.

3715	TJUSLS_China	PETAres--- PETase with improved thermal stability	Discarded PET in the environment has caused serious ecological and health problems at present. Enzymatic recycling of PET has been extensively investigated in the past 20 years. PETase is a novel PET-degrading enzyme with the ability to degrade the highly crystallized PET. However, the heat-labile property seriously hinders its industrial applications. To over this limitation, we firstly rationally designed several PETase mutants through our combine bioinformatics strategies. Then we cloned and expressed these mutant genes by using the E. coli system. We next purified all the expressed PETase mutants and tested their thermostability at several conditions. We found 7 of PETase mutants with increasing thermostability. Excitingly, the enzyme activity of one mutant was 163 times that of the wild-type PETase at 60°C that was 20°C higher than the optimum temperature of the wild-type PETase. Our project sheds light on the industrial application of PETase.

3716	iBowu-China	Glycyr?: synthesis of glycyrrhetinic acid	Glycyrrhetinic Acid (GA) is an important herbal extract from the most widely used Chinese herbal medicine Licorice with applications both in the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is an approved effective medicine for peptic ulcers and has expectorant properties, and current research reported potential use for anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and in cancer treatments. The conventional extraction method using hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin (GL) suffers from high cost and high environmental pressure, which undermines its large-scale usage. Syn-bio pathways can potentially lower the cost, and are eco-friendly. Therefore, Team iBowu-China investigated synthetic methods using the enzyme beta-glucuronidase (bG) to hydrolyze GL into GA by experimenting with the coding sequence from different species. Our results indicate the enzyme can be stably produced with a good hydrolysis activity under proper conditions.

3717	TAS_Taipei	UniversO: Enzymatic Blood Type Conversion to Eliminate Transfusion Incompatibility	Blood transfusions are an integral component of healthcare, but the availability of blood is limited by patient-donor blood type specificity. This leads to blood shortages worldwide, especially in developing countries and during times of pandemics or natural disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate the blood shortage issue, this project aims to increase the supply of universal donor blood through the enzymatic conversion of A, B, and AB blood types to O type, eliminating patient donor incompatibility. We have identified 3 glycoside hydrolases that act as molecular scissors to cleave off terminal residues on A and B RBC surface antigens, preventing cells from eliciting an immune response. We propose a modular, two step blood conversion kit housing our recombinant enzymes that can be implemented into blood banks and processing centers, increasing access to universal donor blood for all.

3718	Hong_Kong_UCCKE	A Synthetic Biology Toolkit - Bacterial-based Detection with Coupled Cell Proliferation Control	Biological detection systems are not often associated with cell proliferation. Here, we propose a novel bacterial-based detection toolkit where the detection of the target substance will restore normal cell proliferation in genetically modified <i>E. Coli</i> with knocked out growth-related genes. When using the toolkit, a recombinant plasmid is first transformed into a wildtype <i>E. Coli</i> to knockout two genes, using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, to reduce its growth. After the knockout, another plasmid containing a modular receptor platform (MRP), genes that restore growth rates, and a multiple cloning site (MCS), are transformed. The MRP with a customizable receptor domain can bind to its operon to activate downstream genes after binding its ligand. Genes used to restore growth and a choice of the user would be expressed. We envision the detection toolkit to have various uses, such as the amplification of signals and the detection of diseases.

3719	MichiganState	A multi-tiered biocontainment strategy for the prevention of horizontal gene transfer in transgenic microbes	To combat unwanted horizontal gene transfer in transgenic microbes, we are creating a multi-faceted biocontainment system designed to work in Escherichia coli. First, we use the GhoST toxin-antitoxin system to induce cell death in unintended recipients without the corresponding antitoxin. We are also designing a CRISPR-Cas9 based artificial immunity system to cleave conjugative plasmids that enter the host cell, preventing it from gaining conjugative machinery that would allow transfer of synthetic parts. In order to understand how our strategy would behave in a microbial community, we developed an assay to assess horizontal gene transfer from donor to recipient. We also use a Markov’s model and an agent-based model (ABM) to imitate genetic transfer using biophysical and community-based methods, respectively. We hope this system could be used by future iGEM teams to enhance their biocontainment efforts and allow teams to move towards implementation in less controlled environments.

The E. coli will be used in an environment where human life is at risk, and the luminescence of the E. coli will alert the user in advance of danger. In addition, we plan to make the E. coli die by itself after reacting for a while, assuming that the person handling the E. coli runs away at once in a dangerous situation. This is to prevent the worst-case scenario of accidentally releasing the synthetic organism into the environment. By using synthetic biology, we hope to create a multifunctional E. coli bacterium that can protect the safety of people in dangerous situations.

3722	NWU-CHINA-A	An adventure of ancient snails: Revive Tyrian purple by E.coli	Tyrian purple is a natural dye that originally extracted from the secretion of sea snails in the ancient times, whose production cost thousands of snails and heavily relied on manpower. Nevertheless, there is not a method to prepare Tyrian purple in a large scale by now. Thus, we aim to realize the biosynthesis of 6,6-dibromoindigo, which is the main chemical constituent of Tyrian purple. The pathway begins from tryptophan and sodium bromide and end in 6,6-dibromoindigo, consisting of three successive reactions. To reduce the insolubility of the halogenase in the first reaction, we add a flavin reductase as a soluble tag on the N-terminal of the halogenase. Moreover, we get a tryptophanase knocked out strain by CRISPR/Cas9 to avoid the potential side reactions. Also we established a whole-cell reaction system to produce 6,6-dibromoindigo cheaply and efficiently. In addition, a dyeing protocol was developed to utilize our Tyrian purple products.

3723	USAFA	DeFluorine Machine: Biodegradation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) utilizing Delftia acidovorans Enzymes	Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist in the environment and are associated with liver and kidney disease, altered immune function, lower birth weight, and cancer. More than 4,000 PFAS chemicals have been manufactured for industrial use. PFAS discharge seeps into ground water and bioaccumulates, resulting in unsafe human exposure. Responding to this urgent need, the US Air Force Academy iGEM team identified the aerobic bacterial species Delftia acidovorans from PFAS-contaminated soil with the potential ability to breakdown PFAS. Genetic sequencing of D. acidovorans revealed coding for 5 dehalogenase enzymes (DeHa 1-5). The dehalogenases genes were cloned individually into E. coli expression vectors. Assays of these purified enzymes revealed monodefluorination activity for DeHa 2 and 4. DeHa 1 and DeHa 5 show promising preliminary data and may prove capable of degrading perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). With further research and enzyme optimization, our enzymes could offer a powerful, inexpensive prospect for PFAS biodegradation.	Environment	Bronze Medal			2021	John Sitko, J.

To combat these barriers and increase the frequency of hydroponics use, AgroSENSE provides an accurate and efficient method of nutrient monitoring and pathogen detection, while simultaneously addressing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We utilize our phosphate and nitrate biosensors and Fusarium and Phytophthora toehold switches in conjunction with our frugal plate reader for fluorescence quantification. To safely distribute our biosensors, we developed a frugal lyophilizer to freeze-dry cell-free lysates and bacterial samples. We collaborated with the Georgia Department of Agriculture on a regulatory proposal for agricultural biosensors to address biosecurity gaps and led community-centered synthetic biology educational outreach programs.

3727	Thessaloniki	METIS: A toehold-based diagnostic tool for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and it is characterized by its devastating outcome, with only a 10% 5-year survival rate. As in other cancer types, it is considered that the earlier diagnosis could contribute to a more efficient treatment. However, the currently available diagnostic methods are unable to detect the tumor at an early stage. Thus, we are designing a toehold-based system to detect specific molecules, called miRNAs, that play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle and are upregulated in the urine of patients in the first two stages of PDAC. We hope that this tool can be used by local diagnostic centers to provide a cost-effective, non-invasive and easily accessible diagnostic method.

3728	Mingdao	deSALMONEtor - a phage-based Salmonella detector	Designer phage is a synthetic programmable bacteriophage utilized in diagnosis, vaccine, drug delivery in medicine. Salmonella spp. are a leading cause of food poisoning. Phage typing is a traditional method for characterizing distinct bacterial strains through specific recognition. Phage reporters have been genetically equipped with GFP or luciferase gene and applied in detecting Salmonella in contaminated food. However, the limitation and challenges still hinder its application to routine sample examination. In our project, we have created a Salmonella detector by introducing phi29 DNA polymerase gene into an isolated Salmonella phage genome through in vitro Tol2 transposon system. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) will be triggered in the presence of phi29 DNA polymerase generated by the reporter phage-infected Salmonella cells. The RCA products can be easily measured with a DNA-binding dye. Implementation in mathematical modeling and hardware design will help to understand the potential use in the real world.

3729	KCIS_NewTaipei	D-licious: Engineering Butyrate-producing Bacteria to Combat Vitamin D Deficiency	From regulating calcium homeostasis, strengthening the immune system, and even preventing COVID-19 infection, vitamin D serves a crucial role in the maintenance of human health. Vitamin D deficiency, a global pandemic caused largely by the lack of sunlight exposure, has only exacerbated during COVID-19 lockdown. However, all current solutions to vitamin D deficiency present limitations in efficiency or accessibility. Our project presents a new method for vitamin D activation. By manipulating the acetyl-CoA butyrate producing pathway, we can increase the butyrate-producing ability of probiotics. The increased production of butyrate would upregulate Vitamin D receptor expression by increasing the activity of the TGF? pathway, which would ultimately result in a more efficient activation of vitamin D.

3732	FAFU-CHINA	"""Mystery of Fragrance"":Photoperiod Microbial Fragrance Production System"	This year, our team developed a system of aroma production by light-regulated microorganisms, which gives microorganisms the ability to produce aroma by regulating endogenous pathways and cutting into different exogenous enzymes, and through mathematical modeling, determine its optimal culture conditions so that it stably exists in the developed system. By adding light-controlled switch elements to microorganisms, the concentration of the aroma can be changed according to the intensity of light. The inhibition of linalool synthase in Escherichia coli is relieved under light, and linalool can be produced. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can produce nerol in dark conditions, and the related proteins are eventually degraded under the light. Finally, we designed an ingenious hardware device for the whole system, which effectively solved the problem of microbial leakage and aroma diffusion. Looking to the future, our team hopes to apply the system to the development of new nightlights and into people's lives.

3733	HZAU-China	P.E.T: Pets' Enteric Test	"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whose victim almost covers all mammalian species, is an immune-mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions among genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Compared with human-beings, pets are not able to voice their current health conditions directly; thus, delayed diagnosis becomes a common phenomenon. Taking the most common pets- dogs as objects, HZAU-China aims to develop a method based on synthetic biology to detect IBD at an early stage. The modified Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 can sense the concentration change of biomarkers. If pets suffer from IBD, the bacteria will amplify the unperceivable pathological change by producing substance with special smell and release therapeutic protein. Whatever pets' health conditions are, the modified bacteria will release health-care unit, exerting profound positive effects on pets' health. In the future, our project will be further ameliorated so as to apply this detective method to a wider range of mammals."

3737	Alma	Poisoned River	The Pine River is found in central Michigan, near Alma College's campus. Following the closure of the Velsicol Chemical Plant in 1978, many environmental pollutants -- including DDT and its derivatives -- were improperly disposed of and leached into the surroundings, thus coining the name, the Poisoned River. These organochlorides are endocrine disruptors and possible carcinogens have wreaked havoc on the local ecosystem. More than this population were affected. Our solution: a biosensor that uses estrogen receptors to detect these harmful pollutants. Several species of animals have estrogen receptors known to bind DDT, a known xenoestrogen. Linking this to a reporting gene, such as RFP, within a microbe will allow the detection of organochlorides. This can lead to the screening of contaminated areas locally and globally. Ultimately, this biosensor has the potential to save thousands of dollars in not only our superfund sites, but pollution cleanup effort across the globe.

Here, we show our solutions that the Lectin-SpyTag/SpyCatcher can pull down P. globosa colonies and then the hutH-fused proteins suppress the activity of P. globosa. To inhibit M. eduli fouling, Vibrio natriegens are engineered to express LC1KR2, PPO, and TnaA, which function jointly to attach engineered bacteria to the coarse grille and to inhibit M. eduli attachment. Genes rhlA and rhlB are also introduced to remove protection from mussel foot protein(mfp). As for biosafety, a blue-light-activated device, pBlind system, is implemented to control the expression of toxic protein BlrA, which can constrain the engineered bacteria in a reservoir with two blue light strips upstream and downstream.

3744	IISER_Mohali	Estimating the risk of developing OSCC (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma) by quantifying salivary biomarker levels	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent form of oral cancer. Since medical infrastructure is unaffordable to most of our society, an urgent and effective diagnostic tool is needed at present. Our kit, OSCCit aims at detecting the levels of salivary protease biomarkers that are elevated among OSCC patients. It then assesses the risk one has of developing OSCC and might suggest the user to visit a doctor. OSCCit contains an engineered bacterial cage protein - Encapsulin that has fluorophores internally and a substrate sequence externally. When protease biomarkers cleave the latter, fluorescence occurs. This characteristic emission frequency allows us to verify the presence of the protease and estimate its concentration through the emission intensity. Protease biomarkers maintain their activity, giving us the advantage of working directly with a patient’s saliva without any processing. Additionally, 3D printed hardware parts ensure the kit can be used with a smartphone.

Meanwhile, ~5 billion people are at risk of AFB exposure and 80% of them develop AFB-related cancer. The Consumer Council of Hong Kong in 2020 shows that 24% of popular dried spices in HK contain AFB. Meanwhile, the humid weather in HK favors the growth of the fungi, so AFB contamination of improperly stored food is a common problem. Our project aims to synthesize a probiotic E. coli that secretes high activity AFB-degrading enzymes. The applications include: 1. Applying to the surface of crops. While the enzymes detoxify the AFB, E. coli reduces the fungal growth by competition. 2. Purified enzymes will be used as detoxifying spray. This project is in the Phase I stage.

3747	Wageningen_UR	Cattlelyst - Reducing the ecological hoofprint of cattle	Our planet suffers from a large excess of reactive nitrogen, impacting local and global ecosystems. In the Netherlands, almost 50% of total nitrogen emissions originate from the cattle industry, mainly in the form of ammonia. Additionally, cattle naturally emit the potent greenhouse gas methane, contributing to global warming. Experts informed us that currently, no combined solution exists to both threats. Therefore we have developed Cattlelyst, a biofilter for cattle stalls targeting ammonia and methane emissions. Cattlelyst relies upon a synthetic co-culture of two non-pathogenic bacterial species that remove these harmful gasses. We modelled and established ammonia conversion in Pseudomonas putida alongside engineering Escherichia coli to consume methane. Containment of the bacteria in the biofilter is ensured by a combination of auxotrophy and two safety circuits. Thanks to these features, Cattlelyst provides a biological, animal-friendly and biosafe solution to reduce the ecological hoofprint of the livestock sector.

3748	Groningen	Bye-Monia, tackling Dutch nitrogen crisis: Reduction of Nitrogen emissions by alpha-amylase production in Saccharomyces spp.	The Netherlands is producing excess nitrogen, which is harmful to nature and biodiversity. One of the main culprits for this so-called nitrogen crisis is animal agriculture, a vital income source for the Dutch economy. Our project targets ammonia emissions contributing to the crisis and aims to convert them into a beneficial feed additive. Thus, we have engineered Saccharomyces spp. to synthesize alpha-amylase, an enzyme that optimizes cattles’ digestion. This way, their milk production and growth will be enhanced while ammonia emissions will be reduced simultaneously. Residual ammonia will be captured by a state-of-the-art filter device, a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF), and fed back to our GMO. Furthermore, insights from artificial intelligence will be employed to optimize the engineering process. Overall, we have designed a closed sustainable circle in which waste - excess ammonia, is converted into worth - a feed additive for cattle.

Rising ocean temperatures have caused several large coral bleaching events, which are attributed to a shift in the symbiotic relationship between coral and microscopic algae species. Heat-induced oxidative stress experienced by algae eventually leads to their expulsion from coral. PROTECC Coral, a Phase II project, aims to reduce coral bleaching by increasing the thermotolerance and antioxidant capacity of a common algal symbiont Symbiodinium goreaui. The twofold solution involves introducing small heat shock proteins to prevent protein aggregation, and a glutathione recycling enzyme system to counteract oxidative stress. Experiments and computational modelling were conducted to examine and validate the solution, complemented by considerable outreach, both informing the wider population about synthetic biology and consulting with various stakeholders, including Traditional Owners, to assess the value and impact of the project.

3752	Warwick	A fast detection method for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) using CRISPR riboswitches	"<i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> are a highly widespread family of bacteria, some of which are pathogenic. They are traditionally treated with antibiotics, but the antibiotic resistance crisis threatens to remove this option. Some <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> have developed resistance to carbapenems, a ""last-resort"" antibiotic for multi-drug resistant bacteria. Hence, containment is one of the most effective countermeasures against infections with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). However, current methods of testing for CPE are slow and can take up to 4 days for a negative result. Hospitals appear to be a reservoir for CPE – particularly drains, sinks and faucets. To aid in containing the spread of CPE, we propose a novel detection method using a gRNA modified into a riboswitch, sensitive to the presence of a carbapenemase mRNA, coupled with a CRISPR activation system to produce a fluorescent green RNA aptamer. The resulting fluorescence can be viewed under UV light, making carbapenem resistant bacteria easy to identify."

3755	ShanghaiTech_China	Mussel Inspired Biocompatible Osteogenic Material(MIBOM)	This year, we decided to challenge the comminuted fractures and develop a new strategy for bone repair. We get inspiration from mussels, a creature that can adhere tightly to reefs through mussel protein in aqueous environment, and we designed a new biocompatible osteogenic glue. We designed adhesion, hydrogel, regulation and drug systems to make it a qualified osteogenic material. The adhesion system is based on mussel protein, which provides the adhesive ability in aqueous environment. The hydrogel system is designed to provide structural strength and UV-induced mechanism makes it friendly to clinicians. The regulation system is based on cells, we construct a Piezo1-based pathway to make cells sense the stress during the bone growth and secret enzymes to degrade the hydrogel, and then drugs mixed in the gel are released. We name it MIBOM, Mussel Inspired Biocompatible Osteogenic Material.

3756	NJU-China	Targeted therapy of asthma by self-assembled small interfering RNA in vivo	Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease estimated to affect more than 339 million people worldwide. People suffering from asthma can only use different levels of ICS or ICS-LABA to prevent exacerbations and control symptoms. We focus on type 2 inflammation in bronchus, which is common but a key contributor to asthma. Our scheme is to take advantage of RNAi therapy to target TSLP and GATA3 to degrade their expression of mRNA and consequently improve asthma situations. During this process, we use a self-assembled siRNA delivery system where we enclose the siRNAs with exosomes to inhibit the above genes' translation and to subsequently prevent downstream toxicity and immunogenicity, which is superior to the otherwise exogenously pre-assembled systems. Meanwhile, we connected with our community through human practices to raise awareness of asthma. To ensure our sustainable impact, we held a regional meetup and founded an organization called the Nanjing iGEM Association (NIA).

3757	Tuebingen	ATHELAS: A modular screening platform for stabilized antimicrobial peptides expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana	Antimicrobial resistance is one of the ten most severe global health threats to humanity, according to the WHO. Pathogenic bacteria are constantly acquiring resistance to further antibiotics, leading to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant and therefore untreatable strains with the drugs available. A class of new potential antibacterial drugs are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are part of the innate immune response of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, the medical applicability of unmodified AMPs is limited by their low in vivo stability. Therefore, we invented ATHELAS: an AMP-thioknot herbal expression and low effort activity screening platform. In our project, we use highly stable cyclic peptides from plants called cyclotides as a scaffold to stabilize AMPs. We developed a convenient platform to screen the properties of arbitrary stabilized peptides. Our platform includes an array of fast cloning, transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, efficient extraction and purification, and antibacterial activity testing.

3758	Marburg	OpenPlast - Establishing cell-free systems from chloroplasts as rapid prototyping platforms for plant SynBio	Climate change is threatening many of the crops we rely on. To ensure stable food supply, engineered crops will play a major role in our future agriculture, but crop development currently takes about a decade. In our project OpenPlast, we develop cell free systems (CFS) from chloroplasts of different plants, including various crops. Showing that they can be employed as prototyping platforms to characterize genetic constructs, these systems drastically reduce testing times. We use a machine learning guided approach to optimize reaction mixture composition and create a collection of GoldenGate based chloroplast parts to be characterized in our CFS. This toolbox includes regulatory elements for chloroplasts of plants so far heavily underrepresented in the registry. After successful chloroplast transformation, we want to show that data generated in our systems is comparable to in vivo data, proving that our systems can efficiently be used as prototyping platforms for plant SynBio.

3759	BJEA_China	Beneco	Plastics are widely used in the world because of its durability. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most commonly used plastics. Generally, there are 3 methods for PET recycling including physical, chemical, and biological recycling. However, physical and chemical recycling both have limitations,such as the inability to achieve closed-loop recycling and cause secondary pollution. Therefore, biological recycling seems to be a sustainable development approach. Research published on Nature found a mutant LCC (mLCC) which is the most efficient enzyme that can degrade PET. Base on the facts, our group decides to enhance the activity of mLCC by proceeding two approaches, The first is constructing a fusion protein of mLCC and hydrophobins to enhance PET adsorption. The second is using the technique of Bacillus subtilis cell surface display to construct a whole-cell biocatalyst which can improve the stability of enzymes and reduce costs.

3760	LZU-CHINA	Development of CRISPR-Cas13d as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral Strategy by targeting ACE2	Currently, the world is still faced with the COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) which urgently requires flexible and targeted protection measures. The spike protein on its surface binds to receptors called ACE2 and then enters the cell through endocytosis. Inhibiting the expression level of ACE2 is considered to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. CRISPR-Cas13d is an RNA-guided ribonuclease that targets ssRNA. The design of gRNA does not need to consider specific adjacent motif. We select human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) to establish ACE2 stable transfection lines and lentivirus with novel coronavirus spike protein is used as pseudovirus. Through bioinformatics screening of crRNA pool for ACE2 conserved sequence, the lentivirus /CRISPR-Cas13d system was constructed. The system is designed to knock down the mRNA of ACE2 in cells, which leads to a decrease of ACE2 on cell surface. Thus, entry of the pseudovirus into cells is inhibited.

3762	NTNU-Trondheim	SulFind: A biosensor for sensitive hydrogen sulfide measurements in recirculating aquaculture systems	With SulFind, we are addressing acute fish death caused by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Our goal is to design a biosensor that would satisfy industry standards as present technologies for H2S detection are often insufficiently sensitive for toxic H2S levels. Two biosensor systems were attempted, a whole-cell system and a system based on heme proteins. Our heme-based sensor exploits the protein's sulfide-binding capabilities. We use fluorescence intensity to evaluate the conformational change in fluorophore-tagged myoglobin protein bound to H2S. The sensing device will be embedded in a microfluidic chip, which will be compatible with existing methods for monitoring water quality in RAS facilities. As a result, our study seeks to reduce acute fish mortality in RAS facilities, making RAS more sustainable and economical.

To address this long-standing challenge, our project aims to develop a novel acne therapy. We engineered a safe, nutritionally deficient Escherichia coli strain, which could decompose fatty acids in high efficiency and secrete strain-specific bacteriocin, for ameliorating sebum blocking and inhibiting P.acnes growth, respectively. In addition, a fatty acids-sensing system was constructed to enable precise therapeutics actuation only in appropriate conditions, minimizing the side effects of gene leakage expression. Furthermore, a high-throughput microfluidic chip was manufactured for accelerating the experimental cycle of directed evolution to optimize the fatty acids-sensing system. It is anticipated that the Acneraser will build new bridges between acne research and synthetic biology, letting this promising and exciting scientific field enhance everyone's life.

3764	Bulgaria	2021 A Resistance Odyssey	Our team focused on the application of protocols, combining identification of already known and discovery of new genetic determinants, for antibiotic resistance in waste waters. In Phase 1, we gathered information for known antibiotic resistance genes by running full metagenomic sequencing, as well as through selective amplification and sequencing of integrons. This allowed early detection of antibiotic resistance factors relevant to clinically significant antibiotics. Then we singled out genes related to antibiotic resistance, which haven’t been found in the territory of Bulgaria yet. Upon the discovery of new determinants, our project entered Phase 2, in which the determinants were generated using synthesis and gene cloning. The successful completion of our project would lead to the development of streamlined protocols for the examination of the cumulative resistome. This allows for an adequate estimation of antibiotic resistance and provide us with information for future emergence and treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.

We're also seeking to create a one-of-a-kind modular plug-n-play platform to combat other kinds of pollution with minimal modifications. The platform that we seek to create can be used for any bioremediation strategy by just cloning the corresponding enzyme; one need not therefore spend resources on reimagining the exact design implementation for every individual contaminant.

3766	Evry_Paris-Saclay	Evolution.T7	Every life form has emerged through evolution. Successive random mutations followed by selection of the fittest individuals has resulted in vastly complex and diverse living organisms. This process can be accelerated in the laboratory to create new protein variants with desirable properties by diversification of a known DNA sequence followed by selective amplification, an approach known as directed evolution. In vivo diversification with locus-specific targeting has recently become possible using T7-RNAP-guided deaminases. Here, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of this method, we have combined two strategies. First, we use new cytosine and adenosine deaminases with improved mutagenesis rates. Second, our innovative design can target both DNA strands simultaneously, resulting in improved diversification and reducing the bias observed in existing systems that mainly target only one of the strands of DNA in each mutation cycle. Finally, we validate the performance of our system by evolving enzymes, fluorescent proteins and transcription factors.

3769	FZU-China	Development of optogenetic switch-based gut bacteria to potentially alleviate depression by supplying GABA	Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. Although there are treatments for depression, the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication and the decline of treatments from patients can be problematic. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of mood disorders. Studies show that in healthy individuals, GABA-producing pathways are actively expressed in human gut microbiota. Based on these findings, we aim to engineer a dynamically controlled gut bacteria which can synthesize GABA to alleviate depression. We engineer a strain of E. coli to contain an optogenetic switch. When the switch is on, GadB (enzyme) and ?X174E (lysis protein) can be made. GadB can catalyze the conversion of glutamate (which is abundant in foods) into GABA inside the cell. After the GABA concentration reaches a threshold, ?X174E can lyse the cell and release GABA into the environment.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has been under more irregularity, and currently, 25% of the global population is highly stressed out. To alleviate mental dysregulations caused by aggregating stress, iGEM NCKU_Tainan invented “MenTAUR”, a revolutionary solution to CSID. MenTAUR consists of two components: Menbles and f(int). Menbles are edible Taiwanese bubbles containing E. coli Nissle 1917 that can autoregulate the production of taurine, a well-known neuroprotective agent, in the intestine by sensing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-?), which are of higher levels in stressed-induced depressive patients. f(int) is a microfluidic chip that simulates the intestinal environment where the auto-production of taurine occurs, allowing us to model the metabolism of Menbles. iGEM NCKU_Tainan believes that MenTAUR, as your life’s mentor, serves as guidance on your journey to a stress-free world.

Therefore, in tropical and subtropical areas, mosquito repellant products are in great demand. Nootkatone is a new mosquito repellent ingredient reported by EPA with more safety and higher stability, but excessively high cost has caused manufacturing limitations. SCUT-China aims at turning S. cerevisiae into a cell factory for Nootkatone production and improving efficiency by promoter engineering modification. Based on the fermentation characteristics of S. cerevisiae, we combined the upstream regulatory elements of different promoters according to the carbon source response mechanism of promoters, and obtained hybrid-promoter supporting high expression in both early and late fermentation. Further, we increased the transcriptional strength of hybrid-promoters by nucleosome affinity model. It is hoped that this project could help achieve higher market shares of Nootkatone and benefit more people.

3773	William_and_Mary	Orthogonality	Orthogonality, defined as the lack of unwanted interactions among parts of a circuit or between a circuit and host physiology, is a fundamental tenet of synthetic biology. While methodology for identifying undesirable interactions among circuit parts themselves is well studied, assessment of orthogonality between the circuit and the host physiology that goes beyond metabolic burden has received surprisingly little attention, with the few existing methods both costly and technically challenging. To address this universal need, W&M iGEM is developing an accessible toolkit for circuit-host orthogonality assessment in E. coli. This toolkit employs circuits that provide measurements not only of classic burden, but also more encompassing orthogonality markers identified by extensive analysis of RNA-Seq data. These measurements serve as inputs for our integrative, comprehensive mathematical model that provides the end user with overall orthogonality metrics, with the goal of enhancing the efficiency, functionality, and safety of all synthetic biology circuits.

However, this process is toxic and has already reached its limit at around 200 bases. Thus, the demand for more environmentally friendly and effective novel approaches is evident. In this project, we report an enzymatic ssDNA synthesis system with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). In each synthesis cycle, an unspecific number of nucleotides is incorporated. Our unique automated hardware can selectively attach nucleotides to immobilized primers in order to synthesize preset DNA sequences. We present a ternary system to encode and recover the information stored on DNA. This system enables the semi-specific approach, in which information is saved only in the transitions between bases, therefore specific synthesis is not necessary. This opens up a much more approachable and robust system that even allows adding proof-reading properties.

Additionally, given the effects of climate change on the planet, sustainable, carbon neutral fuels are essential to mitigate anthropogenic damage to the planet. SDSU's iGEM team addressed these issues using a three chamber Bioelectrochemical System(BES) inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis in the anode chamber and Methanococcus maripaludis in the cathode. The third chamber is used for water deionization by taking advantage of the BES cell voltage and permeable membranes. Although the BES desalinates, treats organics in wastewater, and creates a biofuel(CH4) from CO2 using the wild type organisms, reactive oxygen species(ROS) genes, protein folding chaperones, and a methane monooxygenase(MMO) were constructed to allow M. maripaludis to synthesize methanol from methane within the BES.

3776	HK_SSC	Biosynthesis of Valerolactam by Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973?	Lactams are family of cyclic amides widely used in the synthesis materials including nylon and piperidines used in drugs. Traditionally, lactams are synthesized through energy-intensive petrochemical methods. Here, we describe a method using Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 as a chassis for the production of ?-valerolactam. A feedback insensitive aspartate kinase (AK) is used to achieve overproduction of lysine. Lysine is then oxidized to ?-amino-valeramide by L-Lysine monooxygenase (DavB), which is further hydrolyzed to ?-aminovalerate (5-AVA) by 5-aminovaleramide amidohydrolase (DavA). The resulting 5-AVA is cyclized to form ?-valerolactam. A shuttle vector with the feedback insensitive AK, davB and davA is integrated to S.elongatus UTEX 2973 through the INTEGRATE system, a previously described CRISPR-transposon system. Since reported cyclases for the cyclization of 5-AVA to ?-valerolactam are not efficient, an efficient cyclase is also designed using computational analysis.

3781	TU_Kaiserslautern	MoClo Mania - revolutionizing protein production by establishing the Modular Cloning system in Leishmania tarentolae	Large quantities of protein are needed every year for research and medical purposes. Production of heterologous proteins in genetically modified microbial hosts has long been established as a biotechnological standard. Still, the production of proteins destined for therapeutic application in humans, often proves to be challenging for conventional host organisms due to complex post-translational modifications most mammalian proteins undergo. Specific modification patterns, such as human-like glycosylation, cannot be replicated in microbial expression hosts, yet are essential to the protein´s functionality. Recently, the protozoan parasite Leishmania tarentolae has emerged as a favorable eukaryotic expression host because of its human-like glycosylation capabilities. To facilitate the use of Leishmania tarentolae, we established a library of genetic parts suitable for the usage of the Modular Cloning system within Leishmania tarentolae. This paves the way to a versatile and expandable gene part collection, making the expression of human-like glycosylated proteins more feasible and effective.

3782	UNILausanne	Aprifreeze - biological treatments to protect apricot trees from frost damage	Late spring freezes cause frost damage in plants, which results in important crop losses, notably for apricots in the Swiss region Valais. When the temperatures drop below zero, ice crystals form and destroy sensitive plant tissues. This problem is exacerbated by Pseudomonas syringae syringae, a common pathogen of apricot trees producing an ice-nucleation protein that promotes ice crystal formation. Our project aims to find biological treatments to protect apricot trees from frost damage. We pursue three different combinable approaches. Firstly, we engineer Escherichia coli to overproduce antifreeze proteins, which we purify and spray onto the plants, so that they bind to ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Secondly, we also produce tailocins, bactericidal protein complexes, to specifically kill P. syringae. Lastly, we want to use a phage that delivers CRISPR/Cas9 and a guide RNA into P. syringae on the plants to delete the gene coding for the ice nucleating protein.

3783	OhioState	Lipid-A Phighter - an engineered phage therapy to combat sepsis	Sepsis is caused by the overreaction of the immune system to an infection. This overreaction can starve organs of oxygen leading to tissue death, organ failure, and even death. Approximately 1 in 5 deaths worldwide are sepsis-related. When sepsis is caused by a bacterial infection, the immune system reacts to an endotoxin, lipid-A. Our solution was a phage that can kill bacteria and release molecules that competitively inhibit or modify lipid A such that the immune response is reduced. We designed recombinant plasmids with multiple promoters and different anti-lipid A genes to be inserted into the phage genome. Beyond the lab, we created a predictive model for baseline gene expression to compare promoter strengths. Additionally, we worked to propose legislation promoting phage therapy and spread awareness about sepsis by creating a children’s book.

We aim to participate in increasing biosafety by using minicells, nanosized and chromosome-free bacterial cells formed by abnormal division of rod-shaped bacteria. We observed their behaviour and hypothesized their use as chassis for local production of desired proteins, without purification expenses. This project is centered around the production of compounds through minicells of E.coli MG1655 containing a plasmid of interest. Minicells are produced using two approaches: overexpression of the FtsZ ring and deletion of the min operon. In parallel, a bioreactor for cultivation and isolation of minicells from parental cells was designed to guarantee a final genomic DNA-free sample. Filtration and introduction of an infection-defective lambda phage into the genome of parental cells was implemented to achieve higher separation yield. We focused the project on production of indigo pigment and found a method to safely dye textile without purification or addition of chemicals.

3789	UM_Macau	BADY--Beer Antioxidation and Depurination Yeast	Gout is a common rheumatic disease. Symptoms including swollen, red, hot, and stiff joints. The accumulated purine in beer is one of the reasons that cause gout after drinking beer. Low purine beer, therefore, can reduce the risk of beer drinkers suffering from gout. Meanwhile, oxidation in beer causes off-flavors and darkened color. Based on these problems, our team proposed to edit the yeast used in beer fermentation in order to produce a beer with low purine content and good antioxidant properties. We engineered the wild-type yeast by synthetic biology method such that the engineered yeast is able to produce and secrete three enzymes--purine nucleoside phosphorylase1 (PNP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and endochitinase (chit42). PNP1 can improve the utilization of purines, hence prevents purine accumulation in beer. The SOD1 and endochitinase will increase antioxidation in the final product.

3791	UPF_Barcelona	ARIA: A democratizing AI-Synbio system to fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria	Drug-resistant bacteria cause 700,000 deaths per year, which could rise to 10 million by 2050. When standard treatments are not effective, saving lives implies rapidly profiling the pathogen's resistance, but traditional methods can delay this process from hours to days. The Antibiotic Resistance Inference Array (ARIA) aims to become a proof-of-concept for an innovative system that tackles this problem. First, we combine advanced algorithms to analyze large amounts of microbe genomic and functional data and define lists of resistance-related markers. Then, we create a library of self-growable biosensors that detect these markers, and we deploy them on a paper-based array: by adding a pathogenic sample to the array, a fluorescence pattern emerges. Finally, a cross-platform computer vision application automatically extracts from this pattern the set of markers found and sends it to an artificial intelligence module, which integrates it with patient-specific information to infer the most suitable countermeasure available.

However, reliable measurements of these compounds are a major drawback for a better understanding of the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain. GutLux, our ingestible biosensor, tackles this by measuring the concentration of the metabolites in vivo, inside the gut. GutLux is comprised of two parts. The biological component responds to the concentration of metabolite by producing a light signal that can be measured quantitatively. The electronic component measures this signal and converts it to readable, wirelessly transmittable data. Our design focuses on compounds associated with mental health, but its use could be extended to other gut metabolites by adapting the biological component. In addition, we have devoted ourselves to create awareness of the importance of the gut microbiota in our wellbeing and its impact on mental health.

To solve this problem, we developed Ammit: a chimeric protein made from DENV epitopes, used as an antigen to capture anti-Dengue antibodies. Based on the bioengineering cycle, we selected the most promising epitopes for Ammit’s design. For this, we analyzed its structure and binding to antibodies using different computational tools. The DNA sequence of the best protein was synthesized and cloned into a plasmid. After transformation of E. coli, expression was induced and the protein was purified. Next, we tested the binding of Ammit to commercial anti-DENV2 antibodies. We also consulted professionals to verify the project's impact on complications due to misdiagnosis. Eventually, Ammit will constitute a point of care device that will provide fast and specific results.

Therefore, we plan to use MlrA, an enzyme native to Sphingomonas spp., which linearizes the ring structure of MC-LR and reduces its toxicity. While previous works have expressed this enzyme in E. coli, we hope to achieve higher yields through two novel methods. The first anchors MlrA on the outer membrane of E. coli via a fusion protein with poly-?-glutamate. The second secretes MlrA into the periplasm using TatExpress, a super-secreting strain, to increase the expression of transport membrane proteins. This project also proposes a microcystin detection method using a two-hybrid bacterial assay. Overall, employing these modified bacteria into a biofilter and detection system is a potential method for reducing microcystin toxicity in a safe, cost-effective way.

3803	Jiangnan_China	Save Coral Reefs at Risks: Synthesis of an eco-friendly bio-sunscreen by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Every year, about 14,000 tons of sunscreen are deposited into the ocean, producing a large amount of chemical pollution, especially oxybenzone and octyl-methoxycinnamate. This has greatly worsened the phenomenon of coral bleaching, and will further lead to the collapse of marine ecosystem, as coral reefs are home to 25% marine species. To alleviate the current situation, we are developing an eco-friendly bio-sunscreen that is harmless to coral reefs and the marine ecosystem. Inspired by how marine species in nature protect themselves from UV rays, we have decided to produce gadusol, a natural UV filter originated from zebrafish, as the main component of our bio-sunscreen product. We first introduced the synthetic pathway of gadusol into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, the utilization pathway of xylose was also introduced to engineer it into a high-yield cell factory. By doing this, we hope to balance the use of sunscreen and the protection of coral reefs.

3804	UTokyo	YEAST-AID	"Incoming aging society asks us: ""How can we extend the healthy life expectancy?"". There are many obstacles to answering the question, one of which is bedsore. A bedsore is a severe wound that often occurs in people who spend a long time in bed. It requires continuous care by medical professionals and keeps patients away from home even after recovering from the initial symptoms. Our team suggests a solid solution to this problem by creating YEAST-AID for bedsore. This project aimed to help everyone takes care of bedsore correctly and efficiently, discharging millions of people from extended hospitalization. Our solution, YEAST-AID is a multifunctional wound dressing using synthetic yeast. The yeast has three functions supporting wound care: wound monitoring by oxygen concentration, infection prevention by antimicrobial peptides, and detection of P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, the yeast is appropriately integrated into the fiber-like hardware to function safely on the wound."

3805	BNU-China	Cheat Me If You Can	In industrial production, inevitable mutations and phenotypic variations will lead to the appearance of cheater cells which avoid the burden of synthesizing exogenous products. Given the liberation from synthesis, cheaters may gain remarkable survival advantages over common workers. Such strain degeneration will therefore lead to a great loss in both quality and quantity of the products. To solve this problem, BNU-China seeks inspiration from a natural colonial model, in which guard bacterial cells can specifically eliminate cheater cells to maintain the balance of the population. We decide to develop a universal cheater-proof platform for industrial production by introducing carefully engineered guards and workers into the system.

Current monitoring policies are insufficient, as more data on hidden hunger is required to implement solutions effectively. However, existing detection techniques remain inaccessible for most people. Here, we present AptaVita: a modular, quantitative, and accessible paper-based rapid diagnostic test for vitamin deficiencies available at the point-of-care. Aptazymes (ligand-regulated self-cleaving ribozymes) engineered through in vitro evolution for binding the vitamins of interest are fused with the lacZ reporter gene. Vitamin-responsive translation activation is enabled in the PURE cell-free expression system on paper support. The colorimetric output is quantified by a portable, 3D-printed, dedicated hardware, allowing us to assess the level of targeted vitamins. We envision AptaVita making hidden hunger visible and addressable, thereby contributing to monitoring and tackling vitamin deficiencies together with those involved.

By establishing this method in planta, we seek to accelerate the evolution of needed plant phenotypes such as (a)biotic stress tolerance. EvolvR, targeted to a gene of interest by a specific guide RNA, continuously diversify the underlying DNA, with cells constantly under selection for improved variants. We have confirmed the efficiency of the approach in E. coli, validated it in a plant-based cell-free system and confirmed its functionality in Tobacco BY-2 cell culture. We have also established mathematical approaches to model and optimize the selection regimens to maximize the efficiency of the pipeline. Our in silico, in vitro and in vivo results further demonstrate the potential of EvolvR to plant biotechnology improving crops and developing new plant-based applications.

We developed a programmable in-situ gene-elimination system, Progenie, to selectively knock-out the Shiga-toxin producing gene stx2 from an environmental microbial community—reducing STEC outbreaks without harming commensal bacteria. Progenie consists of an initial phage delivery of a conjugatable plasmid encoding an RNA-guided transposon system that self-integrates into a targeted locus and spreads to neighboring microbes. Using E. coli with chromosomally-integrated mcherry as a model for stx2, we measure mCherry fluorescence to quantify the effectiveness and extent of our gene knockout system. Progenie can not only reduce STEC-related food recalls, illness, and waste, but can generalize to disable virulence factors or antibiotic resistance in a host of other microbes."

3809	TecCEM	Disrupting Disruptors	We designed a biosensor for the detection of Endocrine Disruptive Compounds (EDCs) in samples of bottled water. This biosensor works through the immobilization of protein receptor hER alpha on a piezoelectric sensor. The protein captures these chemicals, while the piezoelectric sensor senses the change of mass through a change of the natural resonance of the quartz. This signal is recieved and interpreted by a circuit of our own design and will give us information about the concentration of EDCs on the sample of water. We focused on the enzymatic degradation of these compounds as well, through the expression of a Laccase. We plan on introducing this step as part of the purification process of fresh water, guaranteeing EDC-free water to our community and reducing the risk of developing any serious illness.

3811	Nantes	UlValorization	Our project aims to reduce, and maybe even solve, a local environmental, health, and economic issue: Ulva spp. Green tides in Brittany, caused by anthropogenic eutrophication. Eutrophication induces anoxic zones that enhance the proliferation of Sulfacto Reductor Bacterias (SRB). SRB uses Ulva algae to produce hydrogen sulfide, which is deadly for a wide variety of organisms, even in small concentrations. Consequently, the whole underwater ecosystem could be damaged. Using chemical, biochemical and biological tools, our team wants to accelerate and valorize the degradation of Ulva spp., by recycling the sulfate and finding utilization for the remaining biomass (biomethane extraction, bioplastic, and compost manufacture). As it is slowly becoming a global problem, we want to raise awareness of this phenomenon through meetings, games, and social media. Thanks to collaborations with several companies that made our project possible, we expect to encourage other countries to follow up and value their green tides.

While cut flowers are in high demand, they are ultimately treated as disposable products leading to large amounts of pre- and post-consumer waste. To make this intimate and essential relationship sustainable, iGEM Kyoto proposes a colorful palette of measures for each process from flower production to consumption. Our discussions with stakeholders revealed that many flowers are lost to insects or diseases. Accordingly, we attempted to kill pests with RNAi, and developed a virus detection device based on RT-LAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a. Alternative to chemicals, we suggest dsRNA and peptides to delay flower wilting. Notably, for more efficient syntheses of these eco-friendly materials, we proposed a system using asymmetric plasmid partitioning. Although fragility and mortality may add to a flower's beauty, an extended life span will allow them to be enjoyed by many.

3822	YiYe-China	TFPI2 Methylation in Stool Samples for Early Detection of Colorectal Cancer by Toehold Switch	Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. The current method for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer remains as a big limitation. Previous reporters identified syndecan-2 (SDC2) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) were aberrantly methylated in Colorectal Cancer. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) for detecting methylated SDC2 and TFPI2 has been reported as an effective early screening method for colorectal cancer. Toehold switches are a class of RNAs with a hairpin loop that can be unfolded upon binding a trigger RNA for translation initiation of the reporter protein, which plays an important role in clinical diagnoses. In this study, we constructed a toehold plasmid and incubated it in the cell free protein expression system with methylated TFPI2 with a trigger sequence, which offers a non-invasive and visible approach for early detection of colorectal cancer in the future.

3824	Korea_HS	Designing a Cancer-Specific Cell-Penetrating Peptide for the Efficient Delivery of siRNA into Cancer Cells	siRNA is a potent therapeutic agent because of its specificity and efficiency suppressing genes overexpressed during pathogenesis. However, due to lack of cell type-specific and safe delivery methods, it shows limited success in cancer treatment. Therefore, we aim to design CPP which forms a siRNA/CPP complex targeting neoplasia. Two engineered CPP based on buforin IIB - MV1 (-RLLR) and MV2 (-RLLRRLLR) - were tested. Among three types of CPPs, MV1 displayed highest specificity for A549 (cancerous). Next, our goal was to enhance the anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin (chemotherapy drug) mediated by MV1/siRNA complex. Since CYP1A1 is upregulated in doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells, siRNA was designed to target CYP1A1. Our result showed that MV1/siRNA complex efficiently suppressed CYP1A1 gene expression.

3825	CKWA-China	LonEase	Cancer recurrence after surgical treatment is currently a major problem facing humans, and cancer recurrence is a huge threat to cancer patients. For example, bladder cancer has a recurrence of up to 24%-84% of patients within 5 years after surgical resection, and the overexpression of C-MYC protein is approximately related to 44%-69% of the cases. We investigated the urinary tract pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) Lon protein and find it can effectively degrade C-MYC protein, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. We use E. coli to produce highly active Lon protease this year, and propose this protein can be designed into drugs to improve the surgical prognosis of bladder cancer populations with C-MYC gene overexpression.

3826	Duesseldorf	Development of an in-field quick test for the differentiation of plant pathogens	This year, iGEM Düsseldorf sets the focus on pathogen detection and differentiation. The aim is to design an adaptable quick-test with three potential applications. Firstly, to detect common plant diseases on young plants, secondly, to detect pathogens in-field before signs of infection are even visible, with the help of multispectral imaging cameras that identify plants with reduced photosynthetic activity. Thirdly, to be able to differentiate between known diseases that are hard to identify with the naked eye. The plants can be tested with our lateral flow assay consisting of two aptamers that have been carefully selected through the SELEX process. These aptamers bind specifically to either a protein expressed during the plant’s stress response or the pathogenic cell itself, precisely detecting the cause of stress. To visualize general plant stresses immediately, a reporter plant was designed, whose colour changes depending on the kind of stress it’s exposed to.

3827	British_Columbia	DetecTME: Untangling the immuno-modulated tumour microenvironment using a tumour-colonizing bacterial vector and reporter system	Immunotherapies are cancer treatments which activate the immune system against the tumour. While very effective in some patients, many do not respond to immunotherapy. To personalize treatment, tissue biopsies are used to profile tumour immune activity and inform likelihood of immunotherapy response but are invasive and prone to sampling bias. Salmonella bacteria naturally colonize tumours, and have been proven safe as a therapeutic in clinical trials. Our project creates an in vivo Salmonella-based biosensor for minimally invasive diagnosis and real-time monitoring of tumour immune activity. We construct a functional screening system to discover promoters regulated by tumour immune markers across the Salmonella genome, and implement an AND-gate with a split-operon technique to detect multiple biomarkers. The biosensor will be adaptable to detect other clinically relevant biomarkers, and to deliver therapeutics. This project is a gateway to a multifunctional platform to support the growth of immunotherapy and personalized medicine	Diagnostics	Gold Medal		Best Diagnostics Project, Undergrad	2021	Steven Hallam, David Oliver		Ahmed Abdelmoneim, Alina Kunitskaya, Daniel McClement, Evan Gibbard, Samuel Hahn, Samuel King	Ariel Qi, Xinyi Chen	Ali Murtaza, Asli, Brenda Ma, George Tang, Kimia Rostin, Livia Vieira, Madina Kagieva, Meriwether Morris, Michaela Samanta, Muhammad Umar Ali, Myles Osenton, Parneet Sekhon, Patrick Lee, Ryan Hong, Sarah W.S.

3829	IvyMaker-China	The PET-buster Magic Yeast	Our goal is to develop a whole-cell biocatalyst by displaying PETase and MHETase on the surface of yeast cell (Candida tropicalis) to degrade PET waste. Firstly, we chose a robust Candida tropicalis as the host and deleted the URA3 gene of genome to block the uracil synthesis by CRISPR-Cas9. In order to display the protein more efficiently, we must obtain the appropriate anchor protein. Therefore, we built a model to predict the anchor protein candidates. We used an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as the reporter and inserted the codon-optimized GFP gene to the genome of Candida tropicalis by homologous recombination. Finally, we selected the best one from 89 anchor proteins, fused it with PETase, and then incubated the yeast with PET waste. We hope the yeast with surfaced PETase can degrade the PET more efficiently and achieved the recycling of PET waste.

3830	NCHU_Taichung	Artificial endophyte for future agriculture	Our main goal is to use the synthetic biological strategy for achieving an example of circular agriculture. Rice could feed half of the global population, and tons of rice straws are produced after harvest. Inappropriate rice straws management, straws burning, causes problems releasing CO<sub>2</sub>, PAHs, and PM2.5. In this project, we constructed the Clostridial cellulase genes within Bacillus subtilis WB800 and the cellulosomal enzymes could be formed. It will be used for effective straws decomposition and used as a medium for culturing our beneficial endophyte. Furthermore, we constructed an artificial endophyte through versatile biostimulant, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) producing Bacillus subtilis and cultured by saccharified straw liquid. The PQQ containing broth will exogenously apply to the rice and/or other plants to promote their growth. Our example for circular agriculture could be completed by the above strategy, while agricultural waste can be recycled into valuable products and also could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission.

This bacterium is designed to be able to measure the amount of phosphate in water. If the phosphate exceeds a certain threshold concentration, the bacterium will start to form a system to pick it up. This consists of an enzyme that will bind the phosphate into long chains (polyphosphate kinase) and protein vesicles (bacterial microcompartments, BMCs) that will enclose the phosphate chains. According to the design, these modified bacteria will be placed in water in a system that prevents their escape into the environment. After a period of time, the bacteria with the accumulated phosphates will be removed from the water, inactivated, and can be further utilized. We envision their use either as fertilizer or as a source of phoshporus for the chemical industry.

This project aims to improve tissue healing by developing a prokaryotic collagen-based scaffold; this acts as a pre-programmed framework that precisely directs the growth arrangements of mouse myoblasts and fibroblasts. Strains of Escherichia coli were engineered to produce Scl2 proteins with binding motifs for integrin and fibronectin; these customizable protein products were incorporated into a hydrogel, providing a physical structure to which the mouse cells attach. The hydrogels feature optimal spatial distributions of binding motifs tailored to each cell line, causing them to grow in desired patterns due to the differences in their respective ECM affinities for integrin and fibronectin binding sites. The effectiveness of these hydrogels was characterized through cell cultures and microscopic imaging."

3834	CityU_HK	Synthetic Biology of Natural Products: Genomics-Driven Derivatization of Variecolin.	Despite recent advances in medical science, humans are still facing some global health challenges, including emerging infectious diseases and debilitating diseases such as cancer. Hence, there is an unmet clinical need for new and effective drugs. However, a long-existing problem in drug discovery is the cost-effectiveness issue in finding effective drugs for clinical use. To address this, our team aims to develop a simple and cost-effective fungal synthetic biology platform to produce various derivatives of variecolin, a fungal natural product that shows potent therapeutic and antimicrobial properties. The platform consists of the genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae host with (1) a “terpene synthase” biobrick for the backbone synthesis and (2) a series of different “cytochrome P450 monooxygenase” biobricks to derivatize the variecolin scaffold. We have successfully obtained three novel variecolin analogues as confirmed by LC-MS and NMR analyses, and experiments are currently underway to characterize their biological activities.

The invasive chytrid fungus has been prevalent in many parts of the globe but a reliable solution is not available yet. This year, our focus is on the biological control of the chytrid fungus by engineering skin symbiotic bacteria. We designed a genetic AND-gate that produces the antifungal agents (e.g. violacein) only working under sunlight warming frogs and the detection of chytrid. To avoid environmental risks, we also designed a quorum sensing kill switch based on the MazEF toxin-antitoxin module. We surveyed the skin microbiome of frogs for a potential chassis of our design. Our therapeutic approach will contribute to protecting susceptible amphibian species from the invasive chytrid disease.

We used Komagataella phaffii (P. pastoris), a methylotrophic yeast, to engineer this cell-factory since it has been used extensively in industrial protein production due to its high protein-secretion as well as ease of protein purification. To make the cell factory effectively use methane as a carbon source, recombinant pMMO subunits were incorporated from a natural methanotrophic bacteria, M. capsulatus. This way, methane is converted to methanol and K. phaffii can further use its native metabolic pathway to produce protein of interest. In the future, we believe this project will open the arena to produce many proteins of interest using this engineered, methane-consuming cell-factory.

3846	Hamburg	E.T. - The ElectronTransferrestrial	Terpenoids are a large class of plant secondary metabolites used as food-flavors, fragrances or pharmaceuticals like artemisinic acid. Today, terpenoids are either extracted from plants they naturally occur in or produced synthetically using petrochemical starting materials.Only in a few cases have biotechnological approaches been successfully implemented for the production of terpenoids. Despite their chemical diversity, mainly two enzyme classes are required for terpenoid biosynthesis: cyclases and oxygenases. While cyclases are widely used in prokaryotes, oxygenases naturally occur as membrane-bound protein complexes. For functional expression in E. coli, soluble versions as well as compatible reductases are required. Additionally, protein expression places significant strain on the energy metabolism of E. coli.

3847	Tongji_Software	Phage-MAP	Phage therapy has become one of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial diseases, and identifying phage-host interactions helps to understand the possible mechanism through which a phage infects bacteria to guide the development of phage therapy. Compared with wet experiments, computational methods of identifying phage-host interactions can reduce costs and save time and are more effective and economic. Through two methods, alignment-based and alignment-free, our team attempted to find accurate Phage-bacteria interactions, contributing to phage therapy, and further contributing to the application of phage as a model organism in synthetic biology.

3848	IISER_Bhopal	BLAST : Bifidobacterium Longum induced Apoptosis using Smac and Trail (Therapeutic for Solid tumor cancers)	Cancer, the second leading cause of death in the world, registered 19 million cases and about 10 million deaths in 2020 globally. Cancer treatment is both financially and mentally traumatizing for patients as current therapies suffer from a plethora of side effects and are very expensive. Our project presents an innovative approach to treat cancer using apoptosis-inducing peptides SMAC & TRAIL. TRAIL binds to the cancer cells extrinsically, thereby activating caspases, whereas SMAC induces apoptosis intrinsically and also sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. Our chassis organism, B.longum, is an obligatory anaerobe and grows only in hypoxic regions providing specificity to target solid tumours. Furthermore, it has a lactate-based KILL SWITCH to ensure it gets killed outside the cancer environment and an AND GATE ensures secretion specificity to cancer cells only. We'd be establishing the Proof of Concept in E.coli. The objective is to design cheap and viable therapy for cancer treatment.

In the food industry, human sensory panel and electronic tongue are most commonly used to evaluate taste. However, human sensory is costly and subjectively affected, while one electronic tongue cannot measure the taste of multiple food. This year BIT-China devotes to design a Creative Tasting Officer-a yeast cell biosensor to quantify the basic tastes of umami, sweetness and bitterness. Genetic circuits are designed to express human taste receptors heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the intensity of fluorescences would quantitively reflect the respective taste degree of food samples. Furthermore, we develop a series of Soybean based Creative Seasonings and a Flavor Card Website to help people discover their favorite taste.

For every single litre of waste cooking oil (WCO) spilled, more than 1,000 litres of water are polluted. While classic recycling is unattractive, synthetic biology is a powerful tool in order to change this view and attract people to the new paradigm of a circular bioeconomy. To do so, we aim to expand the molecular toolbox of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for developing a bioprocess that creates value from waste. This microorganism stands out due to its ability to use oleaginous substrates to grow. First, we are implementing the full carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in this chassis. Besides, we are optimizing the stock of WCO as its carbon and energy source to produce sustainable paints based on these carotenoids pigments.

3855	BOKU-Vienna	Friendzyme - a novel therapeutic platform in case of Irritable Bowel syndrome, and related disorders	About 15% of the worlds population suffer from bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and related disorders. These are triggered by so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols), which are non-digestible food components that lead to bloating, abdominal pain and other symptoms. So far the only therapy is a highly restrictive diet. We want to change that by addressing neglected gastrointestinal diseases and tackling one of the most common FODMAPs: Fructans, a fructose polymer. Our goal is to develop a novel therapeutic platform by the use of lactobacilli that secrete fructan-degrading enzymes. We encapsulate them in a biocompatible scaffold that keeps them safely inside while allowing the release of the produced enzymes. The surface of the scaffold is designed to have muco-adhesive properties which enable site-targeted enzyme delivery over a prolonged timespan. With this concept we want to take oral enzyme therapy to the next level.

3856	CTR_Alberta_Canada	Detecting oxybenzone via production of LacZ gene induced by GEM protein in engineered S.cerevisiae	Oxybenzone is a chemical compound found in sunscreens that serves as an active ingredient to block ultraviolet (UV) rays. Oxybenzone contributes to coral bleaching by accumulating in coral tissues and reducing sunlight availability for photosynthetic organisms due to its UV-absorbing properties. Through the genetic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxybenzone concentration levels in water bodies can be detected. The estrogenic properties of oxybenzone allow it to bind to a synthetic fusion protein containing a human estrogen receptor which will result in the expression of the LacZ gene. This causes the enzyme beta-galactosidase to be produced and breakdown its substrate. This produces an electrochemical signal which can be measured using the Field-Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) and analyzed to determine oxybenzone concentration. This will allow for greater understanding of the issue of coral bleaching, and provide a tool to assess the impact of further steps being taken to protect these aquatic ecosystems.

3857	RUM-UPRM	R-DetoX: A Biodegradation Solution for RDX Contamination in the Anones Lagoon in Vieques, Puerto Rico	The Anones Lagoon in Vieques, Puerto Rico, has been impacted by the presence of xenobiotic contaminants, whose concentrations exceed established limits by the EPA, with one of concern being a recalcitrant explosive compound, 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Our goal is to design R-DetoX, a two-component genetic circuit for the detection and biodegradation of RDX. An RDX-inducible sensor element is transcriptionally coupled with the quorum-sensing (QS) signal biosynthesis and transcriptional regulator genes, luxI and luxR, respectively. The second component is induced by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)mediated QS, activating PluxR,, which initiates the transcription of the xplA/B system. As a result, denitrification and ring-cleavage of RDX occurs, reducing the compound’s recalcitrance. A fluorescent reporter follows the catabolic component, allowing for quantification of biodegradation gene expression through fluorometry. The biodetection/biodegradation of RDX by R-DetoX will allow recovery of the biodiversity and provide new tools for environmental monitoring and remediation.

Chemotherapy often remains the last resort, with the major drawback of being non-specific. To overcome this limitation we aim to design genetically modified minicells derived from non-pathogenic <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium. We plan to equip our chassis to specifically target cancer tissue and inject on site a cell growth-inhibiting peptide into malignant cells. In a first approach, we validate the chassis-cell interaction by modifying the minicells with lectins that specifically adhere to a targeted cell line. Subsequently, via the type-III secretion system of <i>Salmonella</i>, the anti-cancer peptide Pep8 will be translocated into the cancer cell, and inhibit further uncontrolled cell growth. We believe our approach will provide insights to crucial aspects of cancer research such as therapy-specificity and limitation of side effects.

3862	ULaval	aSAP: a Solution Against maple Polymers	Maple syrup is a Canadian emblem. It’s a big part of our economy and culture. In 2021 alone, Canada produced 45M litres of maple syrup. Maple syrup is produced by boiling maple sap to make the sticky sweet syrup we Canadians know and love. Sometimes, contaminating microorganisms create exopolysaccharides in the syrup. These polymers are dextrans: very long sugar molecules that ruin the syrup’s taste and texture, making it very viscous. When this occurs, it creates ropy maple syrup. This syrup cannot be sold, and so producers must pay for it to be destroyed, creating a waste of food, energy and money. We created a treatment using a designed dextranase to put into the barrels of ropy syrup to make it usable again for producers. Over the past two years, our team was able to express, purify, characterize and do the proof of concept of our dextranase.

At present, paper straws are the most popular alternative to plastic straws. However, paper straws have many defects including bad taste, easy to crack and short lifetime. Amylose is a polysaccharide chain linked by a-(1,4) glycosidic bond with D-glucose. It has poor water solubility, anti-swelling and fat insolubility, which can be used in the production of food packaging materials. In our project, we introduced two enzymes involved in amylose synthesis into E. coli: ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase containing 2 subunits ADG1 and APL1, and granule-bound starch synthase 1 (GBSS1). Once our project is completed, amylose will be synthesized and used for the production of biodegradable straw. It will replace the plastic and paper straws with a broad prospect.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered the promising alternatives to antibiotics. Escherichia coli is the extensively used host for the production of AMPs. However, the expression of AMPs genes is low due to the toxicity of the AMPs. In order to improve the production of various AMPs, the BL21 (DE3)-derived variant strains library with different RBS sequence of T7RNAP was constructed by base editor and CRISPR-Cas9, respectively. Excitingly, the CRISPR-Cas9 system enables to obtain 87.5% of the theoretical values variants in a single editing. Furthermore, the high throughput host screening platform for AMPs production was built, and it takes only 3 days to get the best expression host for certain AMPs production. As proof-of-concept, the production of ten hard-to-express AMPs were greatly improved. We aim to protect the human health and environment by reducing the abuse of antibiotics.

Most bacteria in nature are organized in such interconnected communities; thus the ability to engineer microbiomes constitutes an important frontier for the field of synthetic biology. Effective engineering of microbiomes heavily relies on selectivity: the ability to make the desired changes (e.g. introducing new functions) to certain species but not others. Selectivity is also critical from a biosafety perspective as the introduction of genes into unwanted hosts can cause large ecological impacts. We have developed the first computational tool to selectively engineer microbiomes, along with experimental means to evaluate it.

Focusing on two grand challenges: overwork-induced obesity and anxiety, as they reflect disorders in both gastrointestinal and nervous systems, we based our approach on the current theories of the ‘brain-gut axis’. *E. coli* Nissle 1917 was used as a chassis with enhanced capacity of ?-oxidation of fatty acid, thereby increasing fatty acids consumption from diets to facilitate weight loss. Meanwhile, with a synthetic biology thinking, GABA and 5-HTP with anxiety-relieving effects were synthesized from the catabolic products of fatty acids in our engineered bacteria.

3876	SZTA_RMG_Szeged	Developing a novel, inexpensive method to detect small RNAs in biological samples	Our team aims to create an entirely new way of RNA detection. This method can serve as an alternative for the expensive rtPCR method in miRNA- or other small RNA-detection in research or medicine. We collaborated with GPs and researchers. The method is based on a unique idea of RNA amplification loop. We use magnetic beads coated with single-stranded probe DNAs on which the target RNA acts as a primer for second-strand synthesis. The resulted dsDNA is the starting point of a transcription process in the same medium. The newly synthesised RNAs start the process again and again, thus producing a high amount of dsDNA detected by increasing SYBR Green fluorescence. We calibrated a simple fluorimeter and proposed a self-designed and 3D-printed adaptor for PCR tubes as inexpensive hardware for qualitative analysis. A software tool was also developed to create appropriate DNA-probe sequences for any small RNAs.

Efforts have been made through physical and chemical methods, but with little influence. Biological methods might be more efficient and eco-friendlier. We produce and deliver algicidal polypeptides with E. coli as the agent. The polypeptide works by penetrating cyanobacteria, which triggers cell aggregation and division. The physical delivery unit is designed using mathematical modelling. It is a floating unit with adequate mobility and precise targeting that releases the drug at a controlled rate. For human practices, we asked for advice from algicidal companies and bureaus. We also made efforts in spreading environmental awareness, especially by presenting our iGEM project at the School Club Fair and publicizing our discovery through the DKU MediHealth podcast.

3878	UParis_BME	ExoSwitch - liquid biopsy for early-stage cancer screening	Despite the growing arsenal of antitumor therapies, cancer remains the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide. A tumour starts developing asymptomatically, becoming less responsive to therapy by the time of diagnosis. We can detect cancer sooner by screening bodily fluids, such as blood or urea, for presence of tumour-associated biomarkers. These biomarkers include proteins, nucleic acids, and circulating tumour cells. However, a large-scale screening initiative requires a test for a dynamic marker that appears early during the disease and is shared by multiple tumours, such as microRNA (miRNA). Our prototype microfluidic chip, ExoSwitch, makes nucleic acid detection acessible and simple. By utilizing de novo designed RNA machines termed toehold switches, it allows rapid detection of multiple cancer-linked miRNAs. The “lab-on-chip” technology offers parallel testing for multiple targets and requires minimal equipment to perform the assay. Combining low cost and easy distribution, ExoSwitch can bring accessible tumour screening to patients worldwide.

With OCTOPUS, we intend to create a P1 phage-based system for delivering surfactant and plastic-degradation genes to marine bacteria to disperse oil slicks and degrade PET plastics, creating more accessible droplets and simple hydrocarbons to allow both pollutants to be metabolized by native hydrocarbon-degrading marine bacteria. We are focusing on the surfactant genes Ranaspumin-2 and Latherin which work individually, and the plastic-degrading genes PETase and MHETase which work together. Using Golden Gate assembly, we are creating plasmids containing either surfactant or plastic-degrading genes plus a packaging sequence that allows P1 to take up the plasmid. Once these phages have been successfully produced, we will analyze their lysates with a variety of assays such as the oil spreading assay for measuring surfactant activity and the blue-dye assay for measuring plastic degradation.

Food is easily colonized by pathogenic microorganisms, using quorum sensing (QS) to form biofilms on food surfaces, during production, processing, transportation, and serving. QS is the regulation of gene expression reacting to cell density and is used by both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria to regulate various physiological functions. Our synthetic biology framework consists of two E.coli constructs, Part1(E.bsuahlscout), possessing LuxR to sense and combine AHL in the environment, which will be activated and initiate the expression of mcherry report gene, and Part2(E.bsuahlterminator), containing quorum quenching acylase pvdq fused with GFP to convert AHL into LHL, blocking QS signals. To improve LL-37 peptide generated by Jilin_China, we conjunct it to our Part 2, so P. aeruginosa are exposed to it and killed, and will live under a low-AHL environment. Thus, biofilms are not formed, and food decontamination is achieved.

In both strains, photosynthetic biohybrid systems are introduced by interfacing iodine-doped hydrothermally carbonized carbon on the cell surface, facilitating photoelectron transduction. Moreover, oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase is expressed heterologously to enhance versatility and efficiency. Genes encoding for biofilm and uptake hydrogenase in R. palustris were knocked out to maximize yield. Upon modification, the co-culture of E. coli and R. palustris demonstrated a mutualistic relationship in hydrogen production by exchanging essential carbon and nitrogen sources. A low-cost bioreactor capable of fermentation, gas collection, and quantitative component analysis is developed and packed into an integrated open-source solution. Through metabolic modification and hardware innovation, SJTang hopes further to improve hydrogen production efficiency and lower unit costs.

3890	USP-Brazil	Let.it.bee.	Bees are very important for the environment and economy since they are responsible for the pollination of about 70% of crops worldwide. Some crops are completely dependent on bee pollination to exist. Since the 1990s, registers show a decrease in bee’s populations, associated with multifactorial causes, such as the Colony Collapse Disorder and Acute Intoxication. One of the most worrying causes is the misuse of neonicotinoids pesticides, of which the most used is Imidacloprid. Bees when in contact with contaminated pollen take it to the colony, spreading the toxicity and causing mass deaths. To address this we developed a plant (Solanum lycopersicum) that can metabolize Imidacloprid specifically in pollen. We associated a pollen specific promoter, pLAT52, to the expression of the enzyme CYP6G1, responsible for metabolizing Imidacloprid in the pesticide resistant Drosophila melanogaster. This way pollen remains safe for pollinators while the rest of the plant is protected against pests.

3892	Linkoping_Sweden	CyaSalt - A novel synthetic biology solution to the global freshwater crisis	The world population is consistently growing and integrated agriculture is expanding consequently. As a result, the global need for freshwater is greater than ever and it continues to increase. Accordingly, the world is facing a freshwater crisis that is vastly affecting the agricultural industry in all parts of the world. CyaSalt is an innovative approach to solve this crisis. The aim of the project is to desalinate seawater in an environmentally friendly way using modified phototrophic organisms. These organisms will utilize sunlight to activate the inward-directed chloride pump, Halorhodopsin, that imports chloride ions. Sodium ions will enter via the ion channel MscL. Thereafter, the modified organisms are separated from the desalinated water by a cellulose filter. The organisms bind to the filter via a carbohydrate-binding domain on their surfaces, resulting in desalinated water free from modified bacteria. Hence, CyaSalt provides a sustainable and economically accessible freshwater source for agricultural use.

3898	DUT_China	Artificially designed delicate modular enzymes system for enhanced PET plastic degradation at mild temperature	Wide spreading and utilization of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the world has caused serious environmental challenges and gained much attention. In response, microbe Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers in mild temperature. However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity is highly limited by inhibition effects, diffusion of intermediates and PET surface physicochemical properties. Therefore, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free modular enzymes assemblies. In order to effectively degrade microplastic PET particles, we construct enzymes of IsPETase and MHETase and protein hydrophobin in our complex system via scaffold modular part, which reveal higher catalytic efficiency in mild temperature.

3899	Thrace	Salica: A device for early screening of colorectal cancer using salivary biomarkers	Colorectal cancer has high incidence across the world and the 5-year survival rate for people with a localized stage colorectal cancer is 90%, but only one third of patients are diagnosed at such stage. This problem persists despite the existence of many screening solutions such as colonoscopy and stool based tests. Our proposed solution is Salica, a non invasive, easy to use home device, that accurately quantifies salivary colorectal cancer biomarkers such as specific strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and microRNAs. Firstly, the biomarkers are isothermaly amplified using recombinase polymerase amplification and the produced nucleic acids are targeted by the cas12a enzyme. Upon target recognition a fluorescently labeled ssDNA probe is cleaved by cas12a resulting in a colorimetric output that is quantified by a 3d printed smartphone fluorimeter. In the future our system can be adapted to any improved biomarker just by changing only the RPA primers and the cas12a crRNA.

3900	Bielefeld-CeBiTec	P.L.A.N.T. Plant-based Ligand Activated Noxious agent Tracker - make the invisible visible	As an invisible threat to the environment and human life, remnants of chemical weapons from both world wars still contaminate the soil. In Germany alone, there are over 200 suspected locations. We develop a plant-based detection system for degradation products of chemical weapons that is highly specific and allows cost-efficient screening of large areas while being easy to use. Our plant indicates the presence of toxic chemicals by changing its color to red. For this, we introduce two new reporter systems called RUBY and ANTHOS, enabling the synthesis of the plant pigments betalains or anthocyanins, respectively. If the chemical is present, it is specifically bound by a receptor, which then activates a signaling cascade, resulting in the synthesis of the pigments. Both computational design and site-directed mutagenesis are used to design new receptor proteins. In the future, our plant allows the detection of further chemicals by replacing the specific receptor.

3902	GO_Paris-Saclay	EndoSeek, detecting endometriosis	Endometriosis is a painful and poorly known pathology caused by proliferating uterine-lining cells outside of the uterus. It affects approximately 10% of women worldwide and can take up to 8 years to be diagnosed. Some blood-circulating microRNAs could constitute promising biomarkers as their concentration differs between patients with endometriosis and healthy women. iGEM GO-Paris-Saclay project “EndoSeek” aims to develop a new diagnostic tool to detect these miRNAs, exploiting the nucleases Cas13a and Cas14a1 and the production of a fluorescent signal that could be measured with a smartphone. We modeled the signal amplification provided by our nuclease cascade and attempted to identify new miRNAs endometriosis biomarkers from a public database using artificial intelligence. We created a video game to inform adults and children above 10 about endometriosis and the possibilities opened by synthetic biology. Finally, following our dialogue with patients and doctors, we questioned the ethical implications linked to diagnoses.

3903	St_Andrews	The Overproduction of Shinorine (a UV-Protecting Molecule) and its Potential Application to Probiotic Sunscreens	Chemical toxins such as octinoxate and oxybenzone, found in many commercially-available sunscreens, contribute to coral reef degradation. To combat this problem, a solution was designed whereby Shinorine, a natural, UV-protecting compound could be synthetically overproduced by probiotic Nissle 1917 E. coli - these bacteria would be combined with a lotion containing a carbon-rich nutrient medium, creating a sustainable, ocean-friendly sunscreen alternative that could be applied directly onto the skin. The aim during the Phase II stage was to clone constitutive genes into plasmids, transform these into BL21 E. coli cells, and finally test for the expression of the enzymes of the Shinorine-producing pathway. ATPG, the initial gene in the Shinorine-producing pathway, was successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid, however cloning the other three genes into their plasmids proved difficult. To conclude, it was shown that ATPG can be successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid via Gibson assembly.

3904	Vilnius-Lithuania	AmeBye: prevention and detection tools for eradication of infectious disease amebiasis	Every year about 50 million people develop a symptomatic form of infectious disease amebiasis, and 100 000 die. Although the infection is most common in developing countries, it is relevant to the whole world as travelers and immigrants disseminate the infection. The annual rates, lack of publicly available diagnostic tests, inexistent prevention tools, and deadly consequences of pathogenesis progression have inspired us to create effective prevention and sensitive diagnostic tools to improve the control of this infection. The first solution - probiotic bacteria that synthesize naringenin - a compound that negatively affects the viability of E. histolytica. This would prevent the spread of amebiasis by asymptomatic people and the development of the infection to an invasive form. The second - a rapid diagnostic test, which is based on aptamers and is specific to ameba secreted proteins. This test would enable accurate and specific detection of the invasive E. histolytica infection.

Currently, It is detected after symptoms have arisen by old, antiquated methods that often result in misdiagnosis, ultimately leading to preventable complications in pregnancy such as foetal growth restriction, low birth weight and life-threatening seizures and blood clots. Project Ribotox aims to spread awareness about preeclampsia and to develop a screening tool using microRNA biomarkers twice as early into pregnancy as current methods allow, by detecting two upregulated miRNAs in the serum of patients with the condition with toehold switches, and a novel method of isothermal amplification. This test will be able to take place in a single tube at a single temperature, increasing the accessibility of RNA tests worldwide.

3907	Lethbridge_HS	Knaptime is Over	Our project is an RNAi-based herbicide targeting the invasive plant species, Centaurea stoebe, more commonly known as spotted knapweed. This project was inspired by the 2017 Kenow wildfire’s devastating aftermath in Waterton National Park. The fire created the ideal environment for spotted knapweed to exponentially spread, limiting the resources for native plant species. Biological controls, manual removal, and chemical treatments are presently utilized to combat the infestation. However, these methods can be costly, time consuming or risk affecting local native species. Our project avoids these drawbacks. The bioengineered RNAi system would be delivered to specifically eliminate spotted knapweed by targeting a unique sequence in the Clp protease gene of the plant’s chloroplast genome. We are using a new “one-pot” method for siRNA production and will first test our product on Arabidopsis thaliana. Knaptime is Over will help to preserve the world’s biological diversity and test a new siRNA production method.

It is urgent to establish an effective and rapid drug screening model for AD. This project is going to establish AD models using transgenic fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) carrying the UAS-APP transgene, which will express human APP protein in the fly nervous system by crossing to appl-Gal4 driver flies. These APP-expressing flies will produce AD-like symptoms, including Amyloid deposits, neuronal loss, axon degeneration, locomotor defect, and cognitive deficits, etc. Furthermore, some potential drugs will be selected to assess this fly AD model. We hope that one day Alzheimer's disease can be controlled and cured, and we are also working hard for this.

3910	UFlorida	Mitigating Antibiotic Resistance Through Alternative Selectable Markers and a Conjugative CRISPR Delivery System	Antibiotic resistance is emerging as the center of a healthcare crisis worldwide. In order to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria, team UFlorida seeks to utilize metabolic enzymes in place of traditional antibiotic resistance markers when testing for transformants in the lab to further contribute to the ever growing synthetic biology library for better genetic engineering tools. UFlorida is also developing a two plasmid conjugation/CRISPR system that will deliver and induce the endonuclease activity of Cas9 protein to an antibiotic resistance gene in a bacteria. This will generate genome instability in our target host through a triad of double stranded DNA breaks, thereby killing the bacteria.

3914	SUSTech_Shenzhen	Development of gut microbes to prevent diarrhea-related dehydration	Diarrhea is a major problem in third-world countries due to poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Diarrhea in children (>5 years) accounts for approximately 11% of infection-related death. To address this problem, our objective is to develop engineered microbes that regulate water retention through colanic acid biosynthesis, triggered by dehydration cues including intestinal chloride concentration and pathogenic bacterium quorum sensing molecules (QSM). Pathogenic microbes release QSMs during severe dehydration, resulting in protective biofilm formation. We further include the triggered release of broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides to displace the diarrhea-causing pathogens. As a case study, we selected Vibrio cholera as it is one of the major global causes of diarrhea. Due to the genetic circuit modularity, we can readily modify the quorum sensing module to target other pathogenic bacteria. The aim is to create broad-spectrum, cost-effective, readily accessible and convenient methods of diarrhea management.

3923	HKBU	Ostamer: Tackling Osteogenesis Imperfecta	Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of genetic disorders that results in brittle bones due to improper collagen formation. In osteoblasts of OI patients, the Wnt signalling pathway is inhibited by sclerostin via binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors, thus lowering beta-catenin concentrations, gene expression and thus bone formation. Suppressing sclerostin by a sclerostin antibody has been shown to enhance bone mass and bone strength. However, in phase III clinical trials, the antibody also imposes severe cardiac ischemic events and worsen cardiovascular diseases in OI patients. Ostamer, our therapeutic aptamer, tackles this development via selectively binding and inhibiting loop3 of sclerostin in order to prevent sclerostin from binding to the osteoblast receptors for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, as well as to preserve sclerostin's secondary role as a cardiovascular regulator. Our Ostamer has received US FDA Orphan Drug Designation in 2019 in response to successful clinical testing on OI mice.

Besides, we add the nadE gene for NAD kinase and nox for NADH oxidase. These two enzymes promote the production of NAD+ and balances the NAD+/NADH ratio which is disturbed by the metabolism of ethanol and acetaldehyde to ensure adequate energy supply to the reactions. Alcohol is known to bring great damage to the organs, especially the liver. Worse, many East Asians carry mutated genes that result in even more accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic substance. According to WHO, three million people worldwide die from harmful use of alcohol every year, which represents 5.3 % of all deaths., Therefore, we believe that alcohol poisoning is a serious issue and should be resolved as soon as possible.

3926	XHD-Wuhan-A-China	Nitrate Decomposer: decrease nitrate in soil with rhizobium	Soil compaction is a concrete manifestation of soil degradation. Acidification and salinization caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizer will damage soil structure and lead to soil hardening and compaction. Rhizobia is a type of bacteria widely found in roots soil. In our project, we aim to solve the soil salinization and acidification problem by using the denitrification effect of rhizobia to reduce the adverse consequences of soil hardening. Many rhizobia have the ability of denitrification by decomposing nitrates. We enhanced the denitrification ability of rhizobia by introducing plasmids containing nirK or napA genes, which code for key enzymes in denitrification. This new strain of rhizobium can not only fix nitrogen but also break it down to release the fixed nitrogen from the soil. Furthermore, we also studied the promoter that can sense nitrate concentration, which laid a foundation for the self-initiated denitrification of rhizobia under high nitrate concentration environment.

3927	NUS_Singapore	Photo-Regulated Yeast for Synthetic Biology Manufacturing (PRYSM)	COVID-19 has disrupted global food supply chains, exposing the fragility of Singapore’s food supply chains, of which 98% of food is imported. As Singapore moves to accomplish the national goal of locally producing 30% of its food consumption by 2030, the demand for suitable pest control in the ever-increasing number of farms will surge. Synthetic pesticides are still considered the gold standard in pest control. However, concerns with the negative environmental/health effects of synthetic pesticides limits their use. Biological antimicrobial peptides have been identified as potential substitutes, however, with current Bioproduction methods it is economically infeasible to produce such compounds for use as bio-pesticides. This project aims to produce Human Beta Defensin (as an exemplar) using a more cost effective approach for use as a bio-bactericide/fungicide at the farms.

We created the “Phos4us” system, which makes use of an already existent phosphate regulation pathway in Escherichia coli to react to high inorganic phosphate levels in the soil and produces the quorum sensing molecule 3OC6HSL. This signal allows the cell to actively communicate with neighboring microorganisms, which in return respond with growth and solubilization of the abundant phosphate.

3929	UNIZAR	NANOBODY DE NOVO DISCOVERY BY ARTIFICIAL CDR RECOMBINATION	Nanobodies are proteins that selectively bind to an antigen. Due to its smaller size, they present advantages in diagnosis and therapeutics. However, they are animal-derived, expensive and difficult to produce. Complementary determining regions or CDRs (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) are unique nanobody regions involved in antigen binding. However, even nanobodies that bind to the same antigen have different binding affinities, as they present different CDRs. Our goal is creating a library of artificially developed nanobodies that bind to a specific antigen. Inspired by nature, this is achieved by random in-vitro recombination of the different CDR genetic sequences of already characterized nanobodies that bind to said antigen. These newly formed nanobody gene fragments are expressed in E. coli, generating a library for the screening of nanobodies with higher binding affinity than the starting ones. This way, our system improves the traditional method for nanobody production, being faster, cheaper and cruelty-free.

3930	Toulouse_INSA-UPS	Elixio, a synthetic microbial consortium for sustainable violet fragrances	Perfumes influence perception in our daily life. Behind flowers and chic clichés, perfume reality is not so glamorous as most are issued from non-sustainable processes. This is especially true for scents impossible to extract from the so-called “mute flowers” like the violet. Our Elixio project aims to demonstrate that valuable fragrances could be easily recreated using synthetic biology, even by a small team of students. We designed a synthetic consortium involving engineered cyanobacterium and yeast and allowing a sustainable production of the violet scent molecules from atmospheric CO2. Over the summer, we successfully engineered both strains to conditionally express all the enzymes necessary to recreate the violet fragrance. Moreover, we demonstrated the production of ionones by our yeast which actually smells like violet! The Elixio project has already drawn attention from the industry and we are definitely proud of the new openings created between iGEM and the world of perfume.

3931	Navarra_BG	A project to provide UV protection for plants on Mars	A major factor limiting the expansion of human space exploration is the enormous logistical costs of launching and resupplying resources from Earth. Plants could play a critical role in providing food and precursors for manufacturing medicines and materials in long-duration missions to Mars. The absence of a significant ozone layer and low atmospheric pressure on Mars results in a higher surface flux of UV radiation. UV is potentially damaging to DNA, RNA, proteins, and generates oxidative stress. Therefore, it will be essential to engineering improved photoprotection mechanisms that enhance the performance of the light-harvesting machinery and UV-protection. This project aims to design strategies that endow plants with sunscreens that protect them from harmful UV effects in harsh planetary environments. The proposed solution is to construct a series of Biobricks with UVR8 and PAP1 Arabidopsis genes that allow GoldenBraid assembly of different transcriptional units to produce UV-resistant plants.

Although it has been established since 1982, we are facing some treatment challenges especially regarding the biofilm formation and its role in antibiotic resistance. So, we engineer an E. coli, specifically E. coli Nissle 1917, a probiotic strain to be able to chase the H. pylori, disperse its biofilm using a protease: Proteinase-K, and kill the H. pylori using a antimicrobial peptide, PGLa-AM1.

3933	Ionis_Paris	Cobatect	Vitamin B12 (VB12) deficiency is a common and prevalent condition which can engender neurological and hematological abnormalities. However, current measurements of VB12 level are usually erratic and lack sensitivity. Here, we offer a portable and easy-to-use bioelectronic sensor for assessing the VB12 level in the blood. This home health monitoring device is similar to those that evaluate blood sugar level, with finger-prick testing. Our biosensor uses a modified bacterial co-culture to produce electricity in the presence of VB12. More specifically, a genetically modified Escherichia coli carries a vitamin B12 riboswitch which controls the biosynthesis of lactate. The latter is subsequently metabolized by Shewanella oneidensis to produce a reducing potential. Shewanella oneidensis has the prodigious ability to reduce metal ions, so when it is in contact with an anode it is possible to create electricity. Your B12 levels needs to be kept in check?

3934	Uppsala	Enhancing FGF-2 towards a more affordable growth medium for the production of cultivated meat.	Cultivated meat is produced from animal cells grown in a bioreactor with enriching growth media to meet the growing demand for meat. This innovation in the food industry aims to solve some of the world’s most pressing global crises such as mass animal slaughter, climate change, deforestation and emerging pandemics. Among all the essentials needed for the growth media, FGF2 or bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, is one of the most expensive. This is due to its unstable and short-acting characteristics but most importantly, its production cost. We aimed to improve a number of FGF2 properties that include binding affinity to its receptor, thermal stability and solubility. We designed three such mutants of wild-type FGF2, with each variant being successfully expressed and purified. Some of them were scaled up further. Our long-term goal is to be able to offer an improved growth factor to industry.

Overcoming this pandemic is a great challenge for humanity and it is still a main concern for the scientific communities worldwide. We decided to develop an edible vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 aiming to be a more accessible and easily distributed alternative to conventional vaccines. To create this vaccine, we designed a synthetic gene that expresses specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens into plant cells. Our synthetic construct codes for a chimeric tripartite Spike S1 protein that covers three distinct mutants of SARS-CoV-2. Using the agroinfiltration method we produce high levels of the chimeric S1-protein at the lettuce cells membrane. This antigen protein will specifically activate the Mucosal Immunity in lab animals upon consuming of the plant tissue. This is the first step of our vaccine development that will be followed by the immunization of lab mice.

In the process of cultivation, transportation or storage and the spoilage caused by microbial invasion will affect the health of the fish itself and consumers. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa is an important pathogen of fish, which can lead to corruption of fish and health problems of consumers. In order to reduce these risks demonstrated, a rapid detection of corruption is needed. Our project aimed to use structure switching fluorescence method to verify the existing aptamer found in papers that specifically bind AHLs, the quorum sensing signals of P.aeruginosa. After the verification, we found the aptamers can specifically bind to AHLs based on which we successfully constructed an aptamer-based lateral flow test strip. At last, we accomplished the final version of the test trips that was more portable, rapid and efficient for practical application scenarios.

In our project, we have gotten out of the rut to create the CREATE?Chromosome Released Eukaryote which is Active, Transitory and Environment-friendly?, a yeast without chromosomes. Such cells have no chromosomes and cannot proliferate, but endogenous enzymes still remain active for a certain period of time. Taking advantage of these characteristics, CREATE might be a much safer bio-reactor used in drug delivery and gene therapy. Obviously, the applications of CREATE will never be limited to any certain field. We believe that CREATE has great potential to be applied in more fields deeply and widely.

3940	Istanbul_Tech	Enhanced Vitamin B12 Synthesis from the Waste Li-ion Batteries by Using Scaffold System	Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most common batteries used in the 21st century, particularly for electric cars. When their lifespan is over, metals especially found in their cathodes, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, should be recycled both to avoid contamination and to regain these valuable materials for further usage. LiCoO2, their main component, can be separated by chemical/biological leaching process, and the remaining cobalt metal can be used for different purposes, in our case for vitamin B12 (a.k.a. cobalamin) synthesis. Although the demand for cobalamin has been increasing, its commercial production is still time-consuming and inefficient. Our purpose is to enhance the Vitamin B12 synthesis by improving the efficiency of rate limiting-step in the pathway via enzyme scaffold systems. Besides, by using the cobalt ions from waste lithium-ion batteries for B12 synthesis we aim to increase B12 production and decrease the waste of lithium-ion batteries.

Cellulose, a polysaccharide, is the main compound of paper products and can be degraded by cellulases; primarily performing hydrolysis of the 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages to produce monosaccharides, smaller polysaccharides and oligosaccharides (2,3). In this project, we aimed to find a biological solution to water pollution caused by paper contaminants. For this purpose, we used endoglucanase II enzyme from Trichoderma reesei and removed the linker region, CBM domain and the signal peptide from the gene (BBa_K3941001). Additionally, for the purpose of increase enzyme activity, we designed 2 mutant forms of this enzyme and conducted experiments (BBa_K3941003 and BBa_K3941002). For the same purpose, we also worked on the catalytic region of CelAB cellulase (BBa_K3941000) which produced from Teredinibacter turnerae.

3942	MIPT_MSU	Final destination for cancer: using viral sorting and targeting mechanisms for RNA molecules delivery	Our team propose a new method of targeted RNA delivery to tumour cells using membrane-derived extracellular vesicles with fusion proteins. The endogenous retroviral gene syncytin-1 was selected as a fusion protein to enhance fusional properties with the target cells. Its receptors (ASCT2) are found on some tumors cells, for example, colorectal adenocarcinoma. Using fusion protein, vesicles overcome the potential membrane barrier. In our iGEM project, we were focused on the sorting and targeted delivery of mRNA (GFP and b-galoxidase, reporter genes) to tumour cells. For mRNA sorting we used RNA-binding domain (N domain of gag protein), which can recognize the psi-packaging signal of the HIV1. The mRNA will be associated with the psi-signal, and RNA-construction (target mRNA+psi-signal) will be recognized by the gag protein. Currently, there are no analogs of such systems in the world, so our technology might become a breakthrough in the field of targeted drug delivery techniques.

3944	Chalmers-Gothenburg	A tunable yeast cell factory for micro-scale production of fatty acid-derivates	Fatty acid-based compounds act as important building blocks in many industrial processes. Currently, many of these compounds are obtained through costly and energy inefficient chemical synthesis using base oils. Vegetable oils are promising alternatives, but many of these are drivers of deforestation and biodiversity loss. Finding alternative ways to produce the building blocks that make up the products we use every single day, is a key step in the development of a bio-based economy. We propose that Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered for the production of high-value fatty acid-based compounds in a tunable fashion. We aim to fine-tune reaction pathways in vivo that can be difficult to carry out using conventional chemical synthesis. By downregulating the native fatty acid synthesis and introducing a bacterial system, we can regulate the production profiles using three types of thioesterases linked to different induction systems.

3945	Calgary	Neocycle: The development of novel REE extraction, recovery, and measurement methods from electronic waste	Rare earth elements (REEs) possess unique physical and chemical properties that make them an essential component of many everyday technologies, such as cellphones, televisions, and automobiles. Presently, REEs are not mined sustainably, and current trends indicate that an alternate source is critical to avoid a period of REE scarcity. Neocycle is a system that works to selectively recover REEs from an underutilized source, electronic waste. First, REE extraction is necessary through the process of bioleaching, where the acid-producing organisms Gluconobacter oxydans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, solubilize the electronic waste feedstock. Next, REEs are recovered from the e-waste leachate through the use of the novel lanthanide-ion binding protein, lanmodulin, in an adsorption column system. Finally, the recovered REE ions are measured using one of three novel measurement systems, which are based on lanmodulin fusion proteins. Through this pipeline, Neocycle aims to provide a sustainable and more accessible source of REEs.

3946	Edinburgh	The SuperGrinder: value from waste	We aim to revolutionise the extraction of valuable materials from the most common recalcitrant waste polymers, including cellulose, keratin, chitin and PET. These are all resistant to natural biodegradation but hold great potential for integration to the circular economy. Current treatments are often unsustainable, requiring harmful chemicals, high energy and resulting in downcycling of materials to lower value products. Our team seeks to combine physical and enzymatic treatment of these polymers by constructing a ‘Super Grinder’, featuring enzymes immobilised on silica beads using silica-binding tags. These enzyme-laden silica beads both contribute to the physical grinding mechanism and theoretically ensure that enzymes will have greater access to the substrate surface. Immobilisation may have the added benefits of improving enzyme stability and recyclability, and our design operates at ambient temperatures, decreasing its carbon footprint and cost. We also aim to improve enzyme efficiency using directed evolution techniques.

To keep up with this demand, the number of cows has also skyrocketed. Cows have multiple stomachs, one of them being the rumen. Within it, there exists a microcosm of microorganisms of which the archaea, specifically the suborder, Methanobrevibacter, creates methane (CH4) by using the fermentation byproducts H2 and CO2. Methane, a greenhouse gas, has a global warming potential that is 28 times stronger per unit mass relative to CO2. To tackle this issue our team is producing a microbial feed additive for cows which will express a set of proteins, derived from different species of red seaweed, to inhibit the metabolic pathway of CH4 production by producing a compound called bromoform.

To colonize colorectal cells, we have proposed engineering E. coli cells with chimeric fimbrial cap protein that can be anchored to surfaces. Anchoring occurs via interaction with customized antigens using a SNAP tag. We then sense a hypoxic environment in cancer cells through the oxidative stress response transcription factor OxyR. To achieve this goal, we designed and built plasmids in which OxyR promoters regulate the transcription of the B-galactosidase lac-alpha fragment. Finally, the lac-alpha released forms a complex with lac-omega resulting in functional B-galactosidase that can be used in colorimetric assays reporting OxyR mediated transcription.

One such pollutant is triclosan, a commonly found antifungal and antibacterial agent. While current wastewater treatment plants are able to separate this molecule from water, it is often incorporated in sludge and used as compost where it can find its way back into our waterways. That’s why UChicago’s iGem project hopes to create an optimized enzyme called LACCXA that can chemically degrade triclosan, thus completely eliminating this pollutant rather than physically moving it to another location. Using the laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor as a template, we employed molecular dynamics simulations from GROMACS to analyze active site binding activity at wastewater treatment plan conditions to inform potential mutations that optimize laccase functionality.

3955	Lund	Inhibiting curli formation via genetically engineered probiotics as a preventative remedy against amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases	Amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, are expected to increase as life expectancy rises. Recent studies in rodents, correlated curli biofilms in the gut, and plaque buildup in the brain. To prevent neurodegenerative diseases, we aimed to express potential curli inhibitors via a probiotic chassi, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, and investigate the impact of the inhibitors in the presence of curli-producing bacteria. We applied gibson assembly and restriction enzyme cloning to attempt to insert our inhibitor genes into an L. reuteri expression vector. However, most likely due to our chosen selection marker, transformations were unsuccessful. During the last weeks, we successfully inserted one construct into pET11a, yet with an inconclusive expression assay.

3956	CCA_San_Diego	Collagene	Collagen has countless applications, from cosmetics to supplements to prosthetics, and is useful especially in regenerative medicine as a biomaterial, constituting skin meshes, bone grafts, and artificial organs. While most commercial collagen come from bovine sources, the derivation process is both unethical and poses significant health concerns such as arsenic poisoning and zoonotic diseases. To combat these environmental and ethical concerns, as well as extend research into recombinant collagen technology, Collagene was developed, making functional triple-helical collagen for regenerative medicine. A bacterial collagen called Scl2 was expressed in yeast and E. coli via gap repair cloning in order to create a blank template of collagen that is highly adaptable to various research uses. In addition, we tested a wide variety of biomedical gels and threads that could be used during surgery or woven to replace blood vessels, developing our own wet-spinner for Collagene threads.

3957	Northern_BC	D-tector: an inexpensive, rapid vitamin D biosensor for northern communities	The synthesis of vitamin D primarily occurs in the skin upon exposure to UV light. In northern climates with fluctuating sunlight levels, vitamin D insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) is common. In Canada, 33% of the population experiences insufficiency. Current testing methods in northern British Columbia, Canada, are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. A benchtop vitamin D biosensor that can be implemented in local healthcare facilities would address this problem. Our biosensor will detect vitamin D (25(OH)D) in a blood serum sample. The biosensor is contained in E. coli, and consists of two components: (i) 1-alpha-hydroxylase, and (ii) a chimeric protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of vitamin D receptor and a FRET system (VDR-FRET). The 1-alpha-hydroxylase activates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which has high affinity for the VDR-LBD. Binding of 1,25(OH)2D to the VDR-FRET protein results in an altered fluorescent signal.

3958	USTC-Software	CAT : Convenient and Accurate Tool	Nowadays, machine learning has been devoted to various areas, and has made some magnificent contribution in Synthetic biology, for example, Alphafold2 by Google, which can accurately predict the 3D structure by protein sequence, and some other models predicting the properties of protein sequence. But recently there is still lack of tools that is user-friendly and can integrate existing model and software. Thus, CAT, Convenient Accurate Tool, is designed and is based on the purpose of offering an highly-efficient software to our user. We‘ve collected some important properties of protein sequence. Moreover, we combine CAT with education and build up an education version in order to briefly introduce the models and the achievement that machine learning has done in synthetic biology. By the education version, we hope that CAT can motivate students’ interest and make further contribution in the area of synthetic biology and machine learning.

In this project, an E. coli biosensor is built to activate the phosphorylation of ComE membrane protein and ComD protein in sensor cells and activate the downstream CotA gene to cause color degradation. At the same time, we also try out different chromoproteins that directly produce the color and enable instrument-free detection. This sensor cell uses short-length peptide CSP secreted by Streptococcus mutans as a signal to detect the amount of S. mutans in the patient's mouth. To demonstrate this, contactless cell-free system hardware is designed, which the customers can use the oral rinse to collect the sample and put into our hardware to see the color is shown. The product will therefore be portable and reasonably priced, allowing more customers to have the ability and willingness to purchase.

3962	Leiden	DOPL LOCK - unlock the potential of GMOs	A major challenge in synthetic biology is the containment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside of the laboratory. This includes restraining the physical spread of the organism and transfer of synthetic genes, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This challenge remains as regulatory bodies require sound evidence on the safety of GMOs which is difficult due to the lack of knowledge upon release. Additionally, the absence of risks is not necessarily a definitive proof of safety. Therefore, industry is unwilling to invest and scientists only rarely get permission to gather large-scale data. Here, DOPL LOCK can make the difference: we propose a mutually dependent double plasmid lock which will minimize HGT and the spread of GMOs. Our goal is to provide an open-source, standardised, modular and widely applicable Safe-by-Design biocontainment system of GMOs in non-contained applications. With DOPL LOCK, we aim to drive bio-safety innovations, accelerating the field of synthetic biology.

3963	Heidelberg	How to train your microbiome	With our project, we try to lay the foundations for a new therapeutic approach to treat microbiome-associated diseases. The currently used treatment, FTM, represents a severe interference with the patients microbiome. Our method should be able to treat diseases without changing the composition of the microbiome by giving it new capabilities. We use the natural competency of specific bacteria to take up DNA from their environment. Our idea is to deliver transforming DNA into the intestine to be taken up by these bacteria. Our drylab team processes microbiome 16s rRNA data to find natural competent bacteria. In the laboratory, we performed natural transformation of Acinetobacter baylyi. Additionally we tested the efficiency of phenylalanine lyase and demonstrated that it degrades phenylalanine in gut microbiome related bacteria species. Furthermore, we discussed novel natural selection advantages because antibiotics are no possibility in a patient. Between certain sugar catabolism, beta-glucosidase was the most promising.

We found that microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can degrade aureomycin by Fenton reaction through modification of the cathode. At the same time, to improve the degradation rate, we aim to localize a biofilm to the cell anode as biofilm activity is closely related to the efficiency of microbial fuel cells. By overexpressing the quorum sensing system in the electricity-producing bacteria, we greatly improved the efficiency of the fuel cell and thus the degradation efficiency of aureomycin.

3971	IISER-Pune-India	SynBactory - Recycling carbon dioxide for biomanufacturing using a co-culture of cyanobacteria and E. coli	Fossil fuels are the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, making chemical synthesis based on petrochemical feedstocks unsustainable. Photoautotrophic microbial biomass is a promising alternative to produce renewable carbon feedstocks for chemical synthesis. We have cultured previously engineered cyanobacteria, S. elongatus UTEX 2973, which can recycle carbon dioxide as secreted sucrose. Parallelly, we have engineered butanol-producing E. coli KJK01 to consume sucrose as a carbon source. Growing the two organisms together in a co-culture would allow for a sustainable, single-step, single-pot conversion of carbon dioxide into biobutanol. Our in silico models probed the stability and dynamics of the co-culture system to identify optimal conditions for the production of butanol. We used genome-scale metabolic models to identify key gene deletion and overexpression targets to improve butanol and sucrose yields. Furthermore, we designed constructs to characterise the strengths of native promoters to boost sucrose secretion in cyanobacteria.

3972	TU-Eindhoven	Non-Invasive Monitoring of IBD using Genetically Engineered Bacteria as Living Sensors	Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestine. Globally over 6 million people suffer from IBD, and this number keeps rising. The current monitoring procedure for this disease lacks specificity, resulting in unnecessary follow-up examinations that are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, which calls for an alternative procedure. Our solution, IBDetection, consists of a pill that can be ingested orally by the patient and delivers live, safe, genetically engineered Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) to the intestine. These bacteria include a biorthogonal sensing cascade to detect tetrathionate—an inflammation biomarker—with high specificity, and in turn activates translation of acoustic reporter genes, resulting in the formation of gas vesicles in the bacteria. These gas vesicles can then be measured outside of the body using conventional ultrasound equipment. This method provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use solution to rule out unnecessary follow-up examinations in a specific and non-invasive manner using fast imaging methods.

3973	Hopkins	Symbiotic Bacterium Engineering for Treatment of Coral Disease	Corals are threatened by human activity as they are the victims of rising ocean temperatures and habitat destruction. Certain species are also impacted by infection from pathogenic fungi—one fungus in particular, Aspergillus sydowii, can cause the “localized mass mortality” of Gorgonian corals, commonly known as sea fans (Kim and Rypien). Previous iGEM projects have approached the issue of coral bleaching with the aim of preserving corals. Our goal is to engineer bacteria to fight Aspergillus infection of corals with minimal impact on other aspects of the ecosystem. We plan to engineer symbiotic bacteria (Endozoicomonas euniceicola) common to the affected coral species (Gorgonia ventalina) to secrete antifungal peptides after detection of an infection. As part of our proposed implementation we have developed a quorum sensing cell death circuit to be used in conjunction with hydrogel beads.

Unfortunately, metabolic flux imbalances along with biosynthetic pathway-chassis interactions complicate metabolic engineering and stymie an industry-scale shift to biosynthesis. To mitigate these complications, we have designed a platform technology known as Manifold that sequesters and spatially organizes synthetic, zinc finger-bound enzymes on dsDNA scaffolds inside bacterial microcompartments. Here we detail our progress toward a resveratrol-producing, proof-of-concept device built using the Manifold framework, and present adaptable models which further the utility of Manifold to metabolic engineers. Through the application of Manifold, the process of metabolic engineering is greatly simplified, marking a major step toward a less expensive and more sustainable means of global chemical production.

3981	AHUT_China	Breast cancer-targeting bacterial microrobots	Breast cancer has overtaken lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer according to Cancer Statistics 2020. Expression of HER2 leads to poor prognosis in 30% of breast cancer. Though there are effective approaches for targeting HER2 such as trastuzumab for breast cancer patients, it is often associated with toxicity and resistance. New treatment strategies are, therefore, urgently needed. In this project, we decided to modify the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 to induce the expression of the HER2 artificial antibody and sTRAIL fusion protein in hypoxia, which can kill cancer cells. We demonstrated that sTRAIL fusion protein with trimerization structure could induce apoptosis in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The modified strain with hypoxia-inducible promoter could express the fusion protein in low oxygen environment and induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Our result suggests that the probiotic we designed and engineered would be a potential novel treatment for breast cancer.

3985	TU_Darmstadt	PHIRE BYRD - Phage mediated Immune Response by Recognizing Defensive Sleeper Cells.	Biofilm formation is an important characteristic of many bacteria, which enables them to survive under harsh conditions. Nowadays, biofilms are essential for a variety of industrial applications such as food fermentation or wastewater treatment. This year, our team is working on a self-defensive biofilm to protect it from pathogen invasion. We will biologically engineer our biofilm prototype chassis Bacillus subtilis to automatically sense pathogens threatening the biofilm via quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules. The PHIRE BYRD gene circuit will trigger the production of lytic bacteriophages in presence of pathogens. The phages will then selectively kill the pathogenic bacteria while being completely harmless to humans, hence providing a powerful alternative to antibiotics. Finally, our complementary QS based kill-switch will protect our system from unintentional release of GMOs into the environment. By building on synthetic biology principles of modularity and standardization, our self-defensive biofilm system will be easily expandable to multiple pathogenic bacteria.

3986	LZU-HS-CHINA	NANO'S Eagerness(Nano-Se)	Selenium is an essential element of human body. It plays a role to maintain body health, boost immunity, resist cancer, poisoning heavy metal and oxidation. However, Se is in deficiency in large areas, which has caused health problems among more than 1.1 billion people. The lack and the excess of this element both cause health problems. The existing preparation methods of Se are unstable and not safe enough. Thus, micro-biosynthesis of SeNPs, which is easy to absorb, is a way to use this mineral efficiently and safely. In our study, the new found selenite reductive SerV01 expressed in Staphylococcus aureus LZ-01 can convert Se (IV) to SeNPs, which has the potential to be used as a booster for the production of selenium supplements.

3989	UZurich	BOOM-V: engineered bacteria-originated (outer) membrane vesicles as a novel plant protection strategy	Crop loss caused by phytopathogens is a severe threat to world food security. However, the extensive use of synthetic pesticides has led to toxicity and resistance emergence. Here, we propose an alternative solution to combat pathogens, by using bacterial membrane vesicles to boost plant immunity. We first screened for strains producing large amounts of highly immunogenic outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). By displaying immune elicitors on the surface of OMVs, the protective immune response can be further enhanced. Meanwhile, we also designed bacteria to function in situ, which can sense pathogens and automatically generate OMVs to prime plants. In addition to OMVs, bacterial cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs) are engineered to deliver cargoes (e.g., DNA) into plant cells. Our results show that engineered bacterial membrane vesicles can improve disease resistance, as well as other agronomic traits of plants, which might open the door for a new era of biopesticides and biostimulants.

3990	SMS_Shenzhen	GUM OVER	As one of the most popular groceries, chewing gum is stuck on the table, bench, and street because of irresponsible disposal. Primarily made up of ethyl-vinyl acetate, polyisobutylene and polyisoprene, they are not water-soluble or easily degraded. Removal is generally achieved by steam jet and scraper, but the process is slow and labour-intensive. Other environmental and health problems could also be caused by discarded gum. This year, SMS_Shenzhen aims at fighting against chewing gum. We focus on LCP and laccase in wet lab, expressing them and improving them by directed evolution and rational design. In dry lab, our modelling project optimizes laccase's enzyme activity and verifies the improvement quantitatively. Outside the lab, we conduct stakeholder interviews to collect suggestions for our hardware design. We also organize all-aged education, including lectures and an art exhibition, to raise the public's awareness of protecting the environment and introduce the audience to synthetic biology.

The extraction of putrescine from plants was time-consuming and low yields, which is seen as a vital limiting factor of tropane alkaloids production. Our project aims at genetically modifying yeast to efficiently produce putrescine in large quantities. On one hand, we designed to introduce the spe1gene to over-express the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction producing putrescine from ornithine. On the other hand, we also introduced two other genes, AsADC derived from oats and speB derived from E. coli which could produce enzymes catalyzing the reaction producing putrescine from arginine. All above will make the yeast a factory to continuously biosynthetic putrescine to support tropane alkaloids production.

One way we thought could solve this problem is to use the gene-editing method to edit the yeast when fermenting wheat starch, that way it can accelerate the efficiency of the process when producing alcohol. We edit the genes of xylanase, ?-xylosidase, and acetyl-xylan esterase into the yeast, therefore the gene edited yeast can process these three enzymes by themself. Each kind of enzyme’s role is to break down the polymer of carbohydrate chain in the starch, so the yeast can use the monosaccharides to produce alcohol. Overall, The gene-edited yeast could reduce the cost of alcohol production and take advantage of wheat B starch.

These neurodegeneration diseases are caused by excessive inflammation. Currently, there is no efficient method or medicine that can be applied to cure or effectively ease these diseases. Here, our project presents a novel target- PPM1A, which is a kind of protein phosphatase for medical usage that can prevent and ease inflammation response. The PPM1A activator can be used to repress the expression of certain genes through dephosphorylation in the microglia to prevent it from turning into M1 type. In our work, Compound 5 was demonstrated as a PPM1A activator and its anti-inflammatory effect was determined.

4006	ASU	Genetically engineering the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to sequester arsenic from contaminated groundwater	Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a serious problem both in local Arizonan communities and abroad: prolonged exposure to arsenic contamination can cause cancer, vascular damage, and liver failure. This project aims to engineer the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to sequester arsenic out of water. Metallothionein, arsenate reductase, and ferritin were integrated into the microalgae via the pASapI plasmid in varying permutations. The plasmid rescues function of the photosystem II gene, leveraging the ability to photosynthesize as a selective trait. Metallothionein and ferritin bind the two most common forms of arsenic: arsenite and arsenate, respectively. Arsenate reductase catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, allowing for the ultimate sequestration of the toxic metal to occur in the chloroplast. Transformed algae were incubated with multiple concentrations of arsenic-contaminated media and the final concentration of arsenic after 2-3 days of exposure was measured using ICP-MS to quantify uptake efficacy.

Scarcity of this essential resource drives populations to seek drinking water from rivers, lakes, and wells. However, these sources can be dangerous if they are contaminated by heavy metals. Preliminary studies show that drinking water in Bolivian cities often contains highly hazardous levels of arsenic. In response, we designed and constructed a bacterial biosensor to rapidly quantify water sample arsenic content. The biosensor design strategy is called traffic light; it employs 4 genetic constructs to quantify defined ppb ranges of arsenic content in water. Light color responses indicate lower metal concentrations while increasingly dark color responses correspond to increased arsenic content. We created a portable device that houses the biosensor and allows one to quantify water samples anywhere. Our goal is to make the biosensor available to users in Bolivia and eventually around the world."

Current on-site kits have false-negative rates as high as 33%. In an effort to provide accurate, non-invasive, affordable, and rapid Point of Care(POC) diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and other emerging pandemics, Purdue iGEM since the summer of 2020 has been working on cArgo: an Argonaute mediated microfluidic viral diagnostic device. cArgo extracts viral RNA from saliva for amplification and conversion into dsDNA. The TtAgo Argonaute protein then cleaves the dsDNA using viral strain-specific DNA guides producing ssDNA fragments. These fragments serve as secondary guides allowing the Argonaute to cleave the molecular beacon emitting a quantifiable fluorescent signal for conclusive result determination. Coupling the biologics with chip barcoding and app integration, we hope to revolutionize POC Diagnostics while making data more accessible for simultaneous detection and contact tracing.

4009	Stanford	Mitigation of Grapefruit-Drug Interaction through Engineered Gut-Colonizing Yeast	The grapefruit-drug interaction refers to unpredictable adverse effects that occur when certain drugs are taken concurrently with grapefruit products. Grapefruits contain a family of compounds called furanocoumarins, which are known to repress CYP3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of a large percentage of drugs prescribed today. This interaction causes increased bioavailability of some drugs and can result in unintentional drug overdose. Given the prevalence and popularity of grapefruit products and the number of affected drugs, our project is designed to provide passive negation of the grapefruit-drug interaction. Our plan is to put the gene for CYP6B1, an enzyme from the black swallowtail butterfly that breaks down furanocoumarins, into brewer’s yeast and colonize the human gut microbiome with our modified microbe to provide continuous mitigation and resilience to the drug interaction through the gene’s expression.

4010	McMaster	Genetically Modified Bacteria for Targeted Elimination of Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Inflammatory Bowel Disease	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of immune-related diseases, characterized by chronic inflammation and severe tissue damages in the human gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutics developed using synthetic biology methods showed some efficacy in laboratory studies but failed to produce clinically relevant results. In this project, we performed a comprehensive literature review of recent advancements in the field and we proposed the use of bacteriocin to target the pathogenic bacteria adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which are closely involved in the development of IBD. We constructed a genetic circuit that can simultaneously detect the inflammation marker nitric oxide, and a pathogen-specific quorum sensing factor named autoinducer-3. Upon activation, the genetic circuit expresses colicin E1 and E9, two bacteriocins that can selectively eliminate the AIEC. We designed detailed experimental workflows for circuit construction through Gibson assembly and for functional verification. A mathematical model was also established to predict the outcomes of our design.

4011	LINKS_China	NeoLeathic Age — Revolutionary Leather Substitute from Kombucha, Spider-silk, and Natural Dyes	The booming of the fashion industry has led to rising demand for leather. However, current industrial leather production causes environmental and ethical problems such as water pollution and animal cruelty. LINKS_China 2021 aims to create a sustainable and humane leather substitute using bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by co-culturing Komagataeibacter with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By engineering S. cerevisiae, we induced transgenic expression of artificial spider-silk proteins fused with cellulose-binding matrixes, which increases the tensile strength and flexibility of BC membrane upon binding. Additionally, we enabled our engineered S. cerevisiae to synthesize ethyl acetate, giving our membrane a fruity fragrance. To endow our leather with more fashionable features, we used engineered Escherichia coli to synthesize different di-halogenated indigoid dyes for coloration. We expect our novel leather to be a transformative product that will continue the prosperity of fashion industry through a more humane and environmentally friendly technology.

4012	AISSU_Union	Memory bread?Constructing Catechin Production Pathway in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae	Increasing ageing of population has become a global issue, and the cognitive ability of those seniors, an important measurement of this group’s healthy level. Researches have proven that flavonoids could be potential in improving the seniors’ cognitive ability. We selected nine different genes from plants to build up two plasmids and used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the chassis for expression. The first plasmid uses L-Tyrosine to produce naringenin, a central molecule in the production of flavonoids. The second plasmid converts naringenin into the final product -- catechin. As a crucial member of flavonoids, catechins plays a significant role in improving cognition and cardiovascular health. We hope that catechins could be used as food additive in elders’ daily diet, and therefore improve their memory. And we believe that it has the potential to become a new solution towards seniors’ health in the future.

As such, they have gained widespread commercial use in nurseries and in farming. This year, Whittle iGEM tries to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a main plant hormone, by using Cyanobacteria PCC6803. First, we introduced the gene of yeast into Escherichia coli, and construct the IPA pathway. By taking Trp as the substrate, we verified that the genetic pathway is able to convert 80% of Trp into IAA within 48 hours. Afterwards, we built the expression vector of cyanobacteria and convert it into Cyanobacteria PCC6803. We hope to manufacture cyan sponge bricks that contain this microorganism to produce our product Auxwall, and promote the growth of plants in garden landscaping. We hope that this product will transform the agriculture and landscape design in the future.

4015	KEYSTONE	Rubber Eater———on the biodegradation of rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene)	In the enormous yet growing global rubber production, we see an urgent issue: waste rubber. By interviewing rubber recycling managers in China, we found that only 7% of 12945000 tons of rubber is recycled in 2020, meaning most rubber waste has either entered a landfill/open dump or an incinerator, both entail serious ecological/safety hazards. To combat this issue, we employed Latex Clearing Protein (LCP) as a means of rubber biodegradation. However, the implementation of LCP still faces many obstacles. To facilitate real-time rubber degradation, we introduced a signal peptide named hlyA that allows for the extracellular secretion of LCP, and for water solubility, we added a fusion protein named NusA. In addition, the signal peptide provides our project the potential for sustainable industrial-scale use. With improved efficiency, this project will become a promising and environmentally friendly rubber waste management method, hopefully contributing to the solution of this pressing global issue.

4020	Estonia_TUIT	SALSASMILE	Around 2.3 billion people suffer from caries. The preventive measures include dietary restrictions, exposure to adequate doses of fluoride, and tooth brushing. However, inappropriate tooth brushing may cause dental cavities and harm gums. Therefore, safer and unified oral hygiene methods are in demand. Tooth decay is caused by bacteria that bind the human SALSA protein on teeth' surface, forming a biofilm and producing acids that destroy teeth. In SALSASMILE, we engineer a protease to target the SALSA protein. We expect that cleaving SALSA will remove bacteria even from the inaccessible areas, making oral hygiene more efficient. We develop a simple assay in yeast to select for proteases that cleave the desired sequence. Combined with deep mutational scanning or directed evolution, this is a powerful tool to engineer proteases. Everyone, especially children, people with orthodontic cases, or disabled individuals could use SALSASMILE alongside tooth brushing for improved oral hygiene.

The industry of mining, smelting, and refining heavy metals often leaves behind hazardous waste in the soil and air. Our project, RhizoMet, addresses these toxic levels of arsenic in soil through the use of bioremediation. As our proposed proof of concept, we plan to test the binding efficacy and specificity of our modified metallothionein proteins to arsenic. To accomplish this, metal tolerance and accumulation assays were performed on E.coli overexpressing these proteins. Given an effective model, we plan to incorporate these E.coli into the roots of Lomatium triternatum and other RhizoMet plants, remediating arsenic-polluted areas like those around metal smelteries. Through future iterations of our RhizoMet plant-E.coli system, we hope to expand the impact of this bioremediation method for areas like Northport and beyond.

In order to investigate this problem in our community, CHS_Missouri_US created a synthetic biology system that can examine tap and bottled water microbiomes. Utilizing shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have built sequencing libraries targeting the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes extracted from the water samples. Unique molecular barcodes were attached to the samples to comprehensively identify the taxonomic profile and relative abundance of all genera within both samples. Research was then conducted to determine the pathogenic risk of the microbiota detected. The documentation for this process can be applied to characterize the microbiome of water sources globally and provide insight towards improved water contaminant testing.

4025	Lubbock_TTU	ChiSPY: a Chitin-Sensing Pathway for the novel detection of chytridiomycosis in amphibians	The global chytridiomycosis pandemic caused by fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salmandoris (Bsal), is responsible for the decline and extinction of many amphibian species. Standard in-field detection methods such as MicPCR and MinION sequence internal transcribed spacer regions from swabs of epithelial cells to indicate the presence of fungal zoospores. However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, and result in varying infection intensity across Bd strains. To address these concerns, we developed a microbial biosensor by engineering E. coli to express the chitin-activated V. cholerae one-component system coupled with a GFP reporter. Diverging from traditional detection methods that indicate zoospore presence, chitin in the cell walls of fungal zoosporangia will serve as the biomarker to indicate infection. This novel biosensor will provide field ecologists with an accessible alternative method to conduct preliminary site testing.

This mechanism is developed based on the Type IV Secretion System (T6SS) of Gram-negative bacteria which would inject effectors to inhibit the growth of recipient cells. However, these effectors are inactive in the donor due to the presence of immune protein. In our project, the plasmid that constitutively expresses Tke (effctor) was transformed into E. coli, and the immune factor Ike is induced by tetracycline. After several tests, a suitable concentration of inducer that effectively disables the defense system was determined, which allowing the normal multiplication of the E. coli.

Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a virus that infects 90% of humans in childhood and has the characteristic that it can remain latently in the human body for a lifetime. It has been reported that fatigue over a period of about a week reactivates the virus and is detected in saliva. Accordingly, we decided to create a system to quantify HHV-6 by using CRISPR based DETECTR assay (2018 Doudna et al.), based on our idea that the amount of the virus in saliva can be correlated with the stage of medium-term stress.

4032	Gunma	Breakdown Biofilms in Baths	Hot spring facilities all over the word have various problems caused by biofilms. For example, biofilms protect infectious microorganisms from disinfectants. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that irreversibly stick to non-biological surfaces and grow on the surfaces, producing exopolysaccharides that facilitate attachment and matrix formation. To break down such biofilms, we constructed a vector for expression of a glycolytic enzyme fused to RFP (red) that degrades exopolysaccharides. An Escherichia coli strain was used not only as an expression host but also as a carrier of the enzyme to biofilms. The strain also contained a suicide vector as the second vector that can cause bacteriolysis under some specific condition. Our findings showed that experimental biofilms were efficiently degraded by the glycolytic enzyme that leaked from the lysed transformant cells . The use of the red transformant may make it easier to kill infectious microorganisms with disinfectants or remove biofilms from bathtubs.

The aim of this project is to make NAA techniques more accessible. Two of the key components of PCR are a polymerase and the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). However, the total cost of dNTPs’ production is significant and they are often produced by complicated, unsustainable chemical processes, mainly feasible in centralized laboratories with expensive equipment. For this project, a high yield genetic circuit is designed in order to produce ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and thymidylate synthase (TSase), two enzymes necessary for the production of dNTPs. The produced dNTPs, along with thermostable Pfu DNA Polymerase, also included in the designed genetic circuit, allow for a low-cost PCR, with components not requiring cold storage. This procedure allows for an alternative approach for the production of basic PCR reagents.

4035	EPFL	CuRe: Copper Bioremediation to Revitalize Vineyards	Mildew is a destructive fungal disease of plants including wine-producing grapevines. For more than a century, mildew has been treated with ‘bio’ farming compatible copper-based fungicides which adhere to plant leaves. However, though only trace amounts of copper is present in wine made from treated plants, when rain washes the fungicide away, toxic levels of copper contaminate the surrounding soil, inhibiting new cultivation and biodiversity. Our goal is to remove copper from grapevine rainwater runoff to prevent this pollution. We generated yeast strains which express the normally intracellular copper-binding protein CUP1 in multiple copies and configurations on their surface to enable bioadsorption of environmental copper. As a proof-of-concept for a real-world implementation of our decontamination strategy, we have designed and built a prototype bioreactor to enable the removal of copper from rainwater by our modified yeast. We envision our solution could help protect wine growing regions from copper soil pollution.

It consists of two circuit boards. The stimulation assembly is a modified optoPlate-96. The reader assembly is an array of photodiodes and UV LEDs compatible with a standard 96-well plate. Arduino microcontrollers control both circuit boards to communicate with a general computer and each other. We demonstrate OptoReader measurement of OD and fluorescence in bacterial cultures and show how OD readings can be used for feedback controlled optogenetic stimulation parameters. We expect that the OptoReader will enable entirely new optogenetic experiments with impact in both basic and applied sciences.

4037	Michigan	Investigating the Versatility of Encapsulin Protein Nanocompartments for Drug Delivery	Encapsulins (Encs) are a class of proteins that self-assemble and envelope other functional “cargo” proteins when co-expressed. Encs are relatively simple protein shells, yet they are stable and can carry robust cargo. We believe this represents an opportunity for novel drug delivery. In this work, we investigate the intake of assembled Encs by living eukaryotic cells and whether the Enc containers can be disassembled by protein-degradation enzymes native to the targeted organism. Brewer’s yeast (S. cerevisiae) was selected as the proof-of-concept organism for this project, and mNeon green was chosen as the model Enc cargo. We are cloning bacteria that will produce Enc shells with yeast mating pheromone tags displayed on their surfaces. The tags will encourage the yeast to endocytose the disguised Encs into the cell from the environment. Success will be measured by using fluorescence imaging to confirm the presence of assembled mNeon green-bearing shells within live cells.

4040	NMU_China	Toggle Macrophages	"Elimination of the SARS-COV-2 and balance the immune response are both important for late-stage COVID-19, however, no ideal therapeutics can achieve the two goals for our knowledge. To address this, we have 1) designed synthetic antiviral macrophages with immune-regulatory capacity and 2) demonstrated its feasibility through both in vitro experiments and mathematical modeling. The designed synthetic antiviral macrophages, termed ""Toggle Macrophages"", have the phagocytic capacity specific for SARS-COV-2 and showed pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation according to the level of local IL-6 concentration. Therefore, as ""smart"" therapeutics, Toggle Macrophages can both reduce the viral load through phagocytosis and balance the immune system via phenotypic transformation. We further mathematically modeled and analyzed the feasibility of the practical application of Toggle Macrophages in humans. This work supports the use of Toggle Macrophages as a novel Genetically Engineered Cellular Platform that may be useful in future therapeutic approaches against severe COVID-19."

4043	United_Shanghai_HS	PET Gig Eater	Plastic waste pollution has seriously threatened the environment and creatures. Here, we designed a burying yard with concentrated PET plastics, using the modified Bacillus subtilis carried by earthworms to initially degrade PET ,accelerating the degradation of PET plastics in it. At the same time, the activities of earthworms are used to improve the distribution of engineering bacteria and enzymes,solving the difficulty of frequent mixing in the dump site. The modified engineering bacteria release PETase and MHETase to hydrolyze PET into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid,finally metabolizing it into carbon dioxide and water. What’s more ,we also inserted GFP gene into the plasmid to further track the distribution of engineering bacteria in the soil. And by detecting the fluorescence in the body or feces of the earthworms, we can know whether the engineered bacteria have been swallowed by the earthworms. The expected result is that the engineered bacteria can be carried elsewhere through the activities of earthworms, which will promote the distribution of engineered bacteria in the soil.

4044	LMSU	ASCEND	The question of food supply for the long-distance flights remains still unsolved. Moreover, onboard food production must meet restricted requirements due to the curtailed resources on the spacecraft. ?yanobacteria Arthrospira platens is a perfect candidate in this case. However, it is tasteless. A long-term ASCEND project is aimed to introduce Arthrospira platensis engineered to produce any genes of interest, and flavours in particular, as a new chassis for the synthetic biology community. We have designed and tested a special optogenetic system, which will facilitate switching between different products and help optimize growth and production conditions. Blue light induces anchoring of BcLOV4 protein in the plasma membrane and maintains culture growth, whereas far-red light induces the production of genes of interests by activating the BphP1 light-sensitive protein and forcing it to inactivate QPAS1-Gal4 repressor.

4046	Duke	NODES: Novel Organoid-dependent Drug Efficacy Screening implementing high-throughput, droplet-based brain organoids	Clinical treatment of glioblastoma, a disease that kills over 10,000 Americans annually, is limited by the lack of a scalable, physiologically-relevant model for testing therapeutics. Duke iGEM is developing NODES, a high-throughput organoid-based drug screening platform to characterize treatment efficacy in common glioma variants. We designed a non-invasive reporter device that quantifies the drug response of mutation-specific glioma cells in a mini-brain co-culture model, grown in a droplet-based system. Additionally, we modeled our reporter system, which detects oncometabolite levels throughout brain tumor development, to improve device characteristics and developed a machine-learning based image analysis pipeline for organoid screening. To identify the social and ethical implications of our work, we interviewed patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders and integrated their feedback into our design. By recapitulating the brain microenvironment, NODES has the potential to accurately characterize drug responses, offering new hope to patients in their fight against this lethal disease.

4047	MiamiU_OH	CROP: Creating RuBP Optimized Photosynthesis	Global agricultural productivity is projected to not meet the needs of increasing populations developing higher standards of living. On a cellular level, crop yield is limited by the inefficiency of photosynthesis. Our project aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative RuBP regeneration portion of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Two alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other reactions that act on common metabolites used in the CBB cycle, were explored first via computational modeling. Impacts on growth and reaction fluxes in silico assessed the validity of these pathways in creating a more robust photosynthetic cycle. One of these pathways which overexpresses the native enzyme transaldolase, was also assessed in vivo. Ultimately, we showed the validity of two alternative pathways in allowing a more efficient regeneration stage of the CBB Cycle. These pathways could eventually be implemented into higher plants to allow more robust cycling and therefore higher crop yield.

Most applications are related to neurochemistry and range from the treatment of neuromuscular disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, to the use as stimulants. There is increasing need for large-scale, climate-independent, and local production of tropane alkaloids as precursors for medicinal drugs. Our goal is to remedy the impact of world crises on the cultivation and exportation of these drugs. To this avail, we aim to develop a biosynthetic route for a tropane alkaloid intermediate, tropine, in Escherichia coli and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus.

Our primary goal was to produce a biosensor that creates a purple pigment in the presence of elevated levels of glucose which will act as an indication of feline diabetes. A reaction will occur between the glucose in a cat's urine and oxygen, catalyzed by glucose oxidase. This will produce hydrogen peroxide, which will react with a colorimetric assay to produce a color change.

4053	NTU-Singapore	Rapid Detection of Single Nucleotide Mutations in COVID-19 and Cancer	As we have learnt from interviews, assays that can detect mutations accurately are valuable in the diagnosis of fast evolving infectious diseases and cancer. Furthermore, in pandemics such as COVID-19, rapid point-of-care detection is essential to isolate patients as fast as possible and minimize spreading of the disease. Hence, we have developed a sensitive and easy-to-use diagnostic kit that can accommodate direct patient samples without RNA extraction and deliver results in under 40 minutes. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was utilised to amplify the target genes. After amplification, a novel CRISPR-Cas12a Lb-RVRR enzyme was employed to identify different mutations based on the fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, we developed a probe that was sensitive to point mutations, allowing us to distinguish between different genetic variants in COVID-19 and cancer. Thus, our project has provided with better methods to diagnose such diseases for a better future.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system is applied to disrupt gp24 gene, an essential gene for T4 phage assembly, with LuxR gene to produce LuxR as signalling molecules for downstream system activation and prevent phage assembly at the same time. The assembly-deficient phage cannot therefore replicate in the host cells more than one generation. The downstream circuit outputs binary signals indicating whether the concentration of bacteria exceeds the national standard or not: if the concentration of the target bacteria is higher than the standard, the system will output a visual signal, otherwise, the signal will not be displayed."

Antibiotic use in poultry farming remains high and leads to antibiotic pollution. The problem of AMR is now a serious threat to the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals as indicated by the United Nations. Defending the One Health approach, we aim to design a bacterial mechanism, which can inactivate tetracyclines and macrolides in the surrounding environment, while containing a self-destruction mechanism, activated when it has fulfilled its role. For this purpose, we partnered with iGEM IISER-Tirupati, to share their kill switch based on the action of a modified bpDNase1. The bacterial cell death is regulated by the presence of antibiotics using TetR and MphR as antibiotic sensors.

However, it has shown itself to be a very difficult and expensive process to chemically synthesize psilocybin or purify it from the mushrooms. Despite recent improvements in heterologous production of psilocybin using either bacteria or yeast, current methods persist to be tedious and costly with a reduced yield. That is why we aim to construct an enhanced biosynthesis of psilocybin from tryptophan, by introducing all four different enzymes from the Funghi in Escherichia coli. After successfully producing psilocybin in E. coli, we hope to transfer this system to our ideal, non-pathogenic host organism, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum that only needs sunlight and seawater to grow, thereby making a sustainable and safe cell factory.

4061	HKUST	ShellBi - Prokaryotic Biosensor for Detection of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins	Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), such as Saxitoxin and Tetrodotoxin, are neurotoxins found in shellfish like clams, mussels, and oysters, that cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) by blocking the sodium channels in neurons. Current methods to test for PSTs suffer from massive drawbacks in terms of ethics, complexity, accessibility, and cost. Hence, we are building a prokaryotic biosensor for the detection of a wide range of PSTs that is ethical, cheap, simple, and direct. The biosensor utilises the antagonistic interaction between Shellfish Toxins and Veratridine to induce significant ionic changes within the cell. An engineered Two Component System in the cells senses this change in intracellular ionic levels and modulates gene expression leading to expression of different reporter proteins. Red fluorescent colour is expected when the toxin is present while green when it is not. Small-scale testing laboratories and even shellfish farms could employ our kit for quality assurance of shellfish.	Food & Nutrition	Gold Medal			2021	King L. Chow, Jessica C.M.

Bacteria, such as E.coli, released from synthetic biology labs may be infected by certain bacteriophages and the antibiotic resistance transferred to other bacteria leading to biosafety issues. To better understand this problem, we will assess the potential risk of lateral transfer of E. coli plasmids by T4 bacteriophages under different conditions. We have shown that T4 can transfer plasmid DNA, which does increase the risk of lateral transfer. However, the number of E. coli phages present in our local environment appears to be quite low, reducing the risk. We added four new T4 early promoters to the registry to support our project.

To achieve this, we have continued our work on Synbiofoam, a firefighting foam composed of foaming and stabilizing agents like Ranaspumins (a series of proteins from a native frog) and surfactin and biofilm, both naturally produced by B. subtilis, and whose production will be regulated through a circuit intended to control the bacterium’s own regulatory network. As we continue to validate and modify our project based on our stakeholders’ responses, we believe that our project will positively impact our society and environment."

4068	ABSI_Kenya	Development of a Portable Biosensor for Detection of Selected Contaminants in Drinking Water	Access to safe drinking water is essential for humans. However, drinking water quality is a major source of human infections in low and middle-income countries. Conventional methods for detecting contaminants in drinking water is time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. This study aims to overcome this challenge by constructing and validating a cheap, easy to use portable device for the detection of selected contaminants in drinking water. The “Build, Test, Design” cycle will be employed. Appropriate parts will be identified for the selected contaminants and obtained from the iGEM repository. Modelling and simulation will be done to select the best combination. Next, the designed model will be tested for the detection of specific contaminants. Findings from this study will demonstrate the importance of synthetic biology in solving human problems by providing a user-friendly, inexpensive, home-deployable biosensor.

4071	Stockholm	Mikroskin: an aptamer-based biosensor for the detection of skin microbiome dysbiosis	One third of the world's population suffer from skin diseases, like acne and atopic dermatitis. These diseases can cause a negative effect in peoples mental health. There are several sources to skin diseases and dysbiosis in the skin microbiome is one potential source. In order to find the source of the disease, improve to the research community and strive for more personalized health care, we at iGEM Stockholm developed a semi-quantitative rapid test to detect potential dysbiosis that causes the skin diseases. This has been done by developing aptamers targeting teichoic acid that exists in all gram-positive bacteria, which constitutes nearly all bacteria of the skin microbiome. Moreover, other aptamers target C.acnes and S.aureus, which are known to cause skin problems. After conjugating the selected aptamers to 10,12-Pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) polymers, a color change visual to the naked eye will be obtained when the aptamers bind to their target.

4072	NDSU	Anti-fungal recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli for the inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani growth.	Crop fungal disease is a global issue that costs billions of dollars in lost crops every year. Crops can be especially susceptible to fungus that infect the root system, like Rhizoctonia solani. Although R. solani threatens many major crops, there are no direct treatments against the pathogen, only management strategies. This project aims to genetically engineer Escherichia coli to produce antifungal compounds which alone, or together in synergy, are effective in inhibiting the growth of R. solani. To accomplish this goal, golden gate cloning was utilized to create several E. coli strains with different antifungal genes. These modified strains were then placed in an antifungal assay with R. solani to establish inhibitory and co-inhibitory effects. Future research would explore inserting these genes in bacteria that have symbiotic relationships with crops to protect against R. solani.

4073	WVHS_SanDiego_CA	Project Purified	Aridification and rising sea levels are increasing salinity levels and the little-known effects of global warming are drastically affecting coastal plants, like Liquidambar and Jasmine. This project focuses on the HKT1 pathway and overexpresses the pathway in plants battling higher concentrations of salt, to adapt and over time and breed new generations of more-tolerant plants. HKT1-type transporters are key determinants of Na+ and K+ homeostasis under salt stress and they contribute to reducing Na+-specific toxicity in plants. We created four new parts using knowledge from previous literature in which the chassis, E. coli will act as a device to insert a sequence to overexpress the HKT1 gene in plants. The CrGPDH3 promoter gene from C. reinhardtii was found to be inducible under NaCl treatments from previous laboratory experiments, therefore, the project focused on combining the RIA1 section of the CrGPDH3 promoter to initiate overexpression for the HKT1 transporter.

4074	MIT	B. Syruptilis, a Probiotic Treatment for Maple Syrup Urine Disease	"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to break down branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Untreated, accumulation of toxic byproducts results in irreversible neurological impairment and death. Besides liver transplantation, there is no curative treatment. Those unable to undergo such treatment must strictly control dietary protein intake to prevent metabolic decompensation. However, the gut represents a promising non-invasive intervention point, demonstrated by the amino acid enterorecirculation model. After consulting industry professionals engineering a probiotic treatment for phenylketonuria, a similar metabolic disorder, academic and medical experts, and stakeholders affected by MSUD, we designed a B. subtilis probiotic strain to more efficiently catabolize BCAAs in the gastrointestinal tract. Our approach focuses on overexpressing genes for BCAA importers and catabolic enzymes via a regulatory recombinase switch; and developing an ODE model of probiotic BCAA metabolism based on B. subtilis growth, gene expression, enzyme kinetics, and recombinase activity."

VL is a neglected tropical zoonosis that affects humans and other animals and has been growing in the region of Foz do Iguaçu and the triple border (Brazil, Paraguay and, Argentina). The SynFronteras team (UNILA_LatAm) will develop a strategy to stop VL transmission by improving the paratransgenesis technique with synthetic biology. We will engineer a Bacillus subtilis to produce an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) inside the midgut of the vector, preventing the parasite from developing, without killing the sandfly. Because of its antibacterial effects, the AMP with leishmanicidal activity DRS-N1, will be produced in its non-activated form and then, activated by enzymes present in the sandfly midgut.

4076	UGM_Indonesia	Auviola: a cyanide-regulating system for gold bioleaching and waste treatment towards sustainable non-mercury gold processing	The creation of a sustainable non-mercury gold processing technology has become a considerable challenge. An efficient gold extraction process with less complicated wastewater treatment to minimize the production cost is the ultimate objective of our Auviola project. Bioleaching based on the cyanide-producing bacterium will be engineered, improving the gold extraction and subsequently degrading the off-process cyanide. The Auviola project utilized an engineered Chromobacterium violaceum. To optimize and design the system, kinetic and genomic scale models were demonstrated in both the extraction process and the cyanide degradation afterward. The bioreactor was also designed as the pilot scale for implementing the engineered gold bioleaching process. In the future, this project has the potential to be implemented as a sustainable low-cost gold bioleaching system for the artisanal and small-scale gold miners to bring achievable and beneficial impacts. Moreover, we also contribute to educating the students for understanding and implementing synthetic biology.

4077	NIT_Warangal	Cost-effective enzyme mediated degradation of gossypol in cotton seed meal: A step towards food sustainability	Cottonseed is a potential and sustainable source of protein that can satisfy the protein requirement of nearly half a billion people every year. Despite its nutritious and functional food qualities, the consumption of cotton seeds is severely hampered by the presence of a toxic terpenoid known as gossypol. The enzymatic method has proved to be effective for detoxifying gossypol as it is substrate-specific. To date, the degossypolyzation of CSM by enzymatic techniques remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we have computationally screened for enzymes displaying affinity towards gossypol. The top screened enzymes were cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris and further provided with crude glycerol as a carbon source for cost-effectiveness. Subsequently, the expressed enzymes were verified for their in vitro degossypolyzation ability against CSM. Moreover, the process parameters of enzymatic degradation will be statistically optimized for the maximal reduction in gossypol content of CSM.

4078	WrightState	De novo Synthesis of ?-Terpineol in Escherichia coli Utilizing a Dual Plasmid Model	There is a growing demand to reduce production of chemicals via traditional manufacturing. Industries that would benefit from biomanufacturing of compounds via microorganisms include pharmaceuticals, cosmetics/fragrances, and other commercial industries. One molecule with potential applications in these fields is the monoterpenoid ?-terpineol. ?-Terpineol has been shown to have many medicinal and insecticidal properties. Here, we focused on biomanufacturing ?-terpineol as a potential mosquito repellant. Specifically, we aimed to produce ?-terpineol via de novo synthesis in Escherichia coli cells utilizing an inducible dual plasmid system. The engineered strain was produced by transforming one plasmid which contained the upstream enzymes of the mevalonate (MEV) pathway and a second plasmid which was constructed to contain the enzymes geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) and ?-terpineol synthase (?TS). These enzymes convert the end products of the MEV pathway to ?-terpineol. Preliminary results show that the system requires further optimization and troubleshooting to result in ?-terpineol production.

4079	NYC_B1O	Development of Targeted wild-type Alpha-synuclein Derivatives for Treatment and Prevention of Parkinson’s Disease	In Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, misfolded alpha-synuclein (aSyn) forms protein inclusions (Lewy bodies) inside neurons, causing neuronal degeneration and symptoms of the disease. Previous studies have shown that increasing the number of chaperon proteins inside the cells or boosting the levels of autophagy, reduces the amounts of misfolded aSyn inclusions. The goal of this project is to target these two processes specifically to the misfolded aSyn instead of indirectly tinkering with cell metabolism. Specifically, the chaperon HSP70 is fused to wild-type aSyn (WT-aSyn). This fusion protein will interact directly with misfolded aSyn converting it into the functional conformation. In the second design, a hydrophobic domain and the LC3-interacting region of SQSTM1 are fused to the WT-aSyn. This fusion protein will drive autophagic membranes to incorporate and degrade misfolded aSyn. Lewy bodies are simulated and monitored using a PD-associated aSyn mutant tagged with the green fluorescent protein.

4080	UBrawijaya	Clean Harvest of Overexpressed Protein System	Indonesia is struggling to independently meet industrial enzyme demands despite efforts to develop cheaper technologies to produce them. Although various enzyme overexpression systems are available, the cost of purification remains a major obstacle. To help address this, we propose the Clean Harvest of Overexpressed Protein (CHOP) system. The system works by anchoring an enzyme of interest (EoI) onto the extracellular terminals of an outer membrane protein (OMP). As the cells grow, they will naturally shed their outer membrane as vesicles (OMV) containing OMP-EoI fusion. Due to OMVs being smaller than cells yet larger than free proteins, they can be separated from the bulk of protein impurities, simplifying the downstream processing. Once separated, the EoI may be released from the OMP by cleaving off a specific linker between the fusion with specific proteases. The development of overexpression systems that simplify downstream purification is expected to significantly reduce enzyme production costs.

4081	Jianhua	Producing 2'-FL by Saccharomyces cerevisiae	2?-Fucosyllactose (2’-FL), one of the most abundant oligosaccharides in human milk, has potential applications in foods due to its infant health benefits. Due to it is prohibitively expensive to obtain 2’-FL directly from human milk, alternative microbial production of 2’-FL is considered promising. Microbial production of 2-FL has been studied mostly in Escherichia coli. To avoid endotoxin contamination and bacteriophage infection in the fermentation process to produce 2’-FL using E. coli, Jianhua aims to produce 2’-FL by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is generally recognized as safe and has been widely used in food industries. First, using FKP to produce intracellular GDP-l-fucose. Second, Lac12 transports lactose, a fucose acceptor in 2’-FL production into cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells. Finally, FucT2, which catalyzes fucosylation of lactose into 2’-FL using GDP-l-fucose needs to be introduced.

4082	NYU_Abu_Dhabi	Rapid detection of fungal pathogens based on electrokinetic concentration and CRISPR-Cas 12a technology.	"Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease that has devastated amphibian populations, leading to substantial losses in biodiversity. Caused by the infection of the fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) or Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), chytridiomycosis causes rapid decline and extinction of amphibian populations. Both species are responsible for fatal disease; however, Bd infects frogs and toads, while Bsal generally affects salamanders. Amphibians rarely display visible symptoms, limiting diagnosis of chytridiomycosis to post-mortem examination, which highlights the need for diagnostic devices. Current methods for identification of the pathogen are laboratory equipment-dependent, time-consuming, and expensive which contributes to the spread of infection. Thus, our team is developing a diagnostic device that allows for rapid detection of the two disease-causing fungi in a field setting. To bypass the time consuming DNA amplification step, we use electrokinetic concentration of the extracted DNA, followed by a CRISPR-Cas 12a complex binding to the Bd or Bsal target DNA for detection."

4083	NU_Kazakhstan	Remi, du et!	Increasing demand for oil & gas production in modern days pushes for higher production and distribution rates. The occurrence of oil spills in such processes is not unusual and the vast majority are left unaccounted for. Existing treatment methods are only efficient for localized spills shortly after the accident, while in the long-term they are less cost-effective and hazardous to Kazakhstani endemic flora & fauna. We propose a solution to this problem by developing a novel agent for crude oil bioremediation - “Remi, du et!”. Specifically, we modify nonvirulent Pseudomonas putida using a dual-inducible system for overexpression of genes nadE and rhlA/B, coding for NAD synthetase and rhamnolipids, respectively. The metabolically-engineered bacteria demonstrate a high yield of rhamnolipids when grown as biofilms under electrofermentative conditions. Since produced rhamnolipids are biosurfactants that emulsify crude oil, the resulting product can be used directly for the treatment of oil spills in ecologically-sensitive areas.

Disease symptoms can be easily confused with other diseases. Current diagnosis methods - PCR-tests - are time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to create a test system based on CRISPR-Cas. It detects herpesvirus by its RNA. We use deadCas13 protein, connected by a linker with two halves of reporter protein - beta-lactamase. Two deadCas13 proteins are directed by gRNA to the RNA of the virus. When the distance between two Cas-proteins is correctly selected, two beta-lactamase proteins can fuse into a functional protein that destroys nitrocefin — the solution's color changes from yellow to red. To avoid false-positive results, we use two guide RNAs. With one guide, RNA reporter protein will not become functional. We are willing to create a system that will not require any special skills to use it. Horse owners will be able to detect herpesvirus using only saliva.

However, they require molecular biology laboratories and trained personnel. Therefore, they are not point of care (POC) diagnostics. Rapid antigen tests fix an antibody to a chromatic paper strip, detecting antigens binding to this antibody. However, since there is no amplification, sensitivity is low. Combining the principles of these methods, our kit works by binding a molecule of the infectious agent on a strip via antibody or DNA probe, then doing signal amplification on the bound molecule. This involves an innovative isothermal nucleic acid amplification at room temperature, not requiring sophisticated instruments. The nucleic acid amplification depends on a synthetic original enzyme that can cut one strand enabling strand displacement by DNA polymerase. This method may enable rapid diagnosis of diseases at POC and help control pandemics.

4092	Tec-Monterrey	Diagnosgene	Agave is a crucial part of Mexico’s culture, ethnicity, and economy. In our country, nearly 558 municipalities are dedicated to its production, and its use for the manufacture of tequila generates a net income of more than 1 billion USD every year, but its production faces an obstacle: the wilting of agave, which is caused by a diversity of fungi and leads to the eventual death of the plant. Current detection systems are either visual or laboratory examinations, but the process can take up to three weeks, and by that time the infection can be spread through the whole land. Our proposal, Diagnosgene, consists of a rapid, easy-to-use, early detection system which can be implemented on the field. The detection which occurs within a cell-free system, is accomplished by the usage of toehold switches, which are RNA tools that get specifically attached to a given complementary sequence.

4093	Shanghai_City_United	Innovative poultry beverage that contains lactobacillus that produces xylanase	Non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), such as xylans, are one of the most abundant substances found in grains but few animals can digest them well. We noticed Xylanase, a type of enzyme that degrades the linear polysaccharide xylan, which could be served as a dietary supplement to treat the poor digestion issue. In this project, we introduced a probiotic which was previously genetically edited by us to possess the ability to secret Xylanase and form a feed that can be applied in monogastric’s, mainly poultry’s daily meals. The product will be designed as a type of “beverage” to make up for the poultry’s insufficiency of the xylan digestive enzymes In this case, poultry will be able to absorb more energy when given the same amount of feed, which will further ease the food resource shortage in the world.

4094	UCDavis	UC Davis iGEM 2021 Project Cargo	Team UC Davis seeks to optimize mRNA delivery in vitro for the foundational advancement of mRNA vaccine technology, namely to reduce side effects caused by an innate immune response due to sudden influx of spike protein. We plan to insert an RNA secondary structure known as an Iron Response element (IRE) into the 5’ UTR that reduces the sudden influx of spike protein by gradually releasing the available mRNA transcripts for translation. The protein known as an iron response binding protein (IRBP1/IRBP2) binds and blocks translation until an iron allosterically binds and IRBP/1IRBP2 unbinds to allow for translation. A working pipeline was created to automate the insertion process and structural stability by utilizing the RNA folding package, Vienna. To prove the mRNA/IREBP system constructs were expressed transiently in mammalian cell cultures and translation was monitored with destabilized YFP. The design is modular and able to integrate into any mRNA therapy.

In the selection of the desired gene, PKC-001 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reported to secrete the cellulase which maintains well activity under both acid and base conditions. Therefore, we optimized its codon and further constructed the plasmid to combine the optimized gene-PKC-OP, which was transformed into the E. coli for expressing itself. Even though we encountered many difficulties in lab work, we finally obtained our engineered E. coli which could express the desired cellulase. We hope this silage additive could contribute the stockbreeding development and improve life quality in the future.

4099	Shanghai_HS_ID	Applications of CRISPR-Cas 9: Increasing the Expression Efficiency of Foreign DNA in Lactobacillus casei	Lactobacillus casei was found to have the potential to cure and prevent common health issues like high cholesterol, hypertension, and gastrointestinal diseases. Recent studies show that L. casei's capabilities in medicine and food are highly restricted by their low transformation efficiency of foreign DNA, due to its restriction-modification system. Our purpose is to improve the transformation efficiency of foreign DNA in L. casei to maximize their benefits. In the laboratory, we constructed a plasmid containing CRISPR-Cas9 in E.coli, then transformed the plasmid into L.casei so that the target gene LSEI-2094 can be removed and the restriction-modification system can be silenced. Lastly, we confirmed the results through both sequencing and controlled experiments to verify the efficiency before and after the modification. Results show that the transformation efficiency has significantly increased post-modification, it is hopeful that this modified L. casei could be applicable in pharmaceutical and food.

4102	Bonn-Rheinbach	BioLan - Protein-based extraction of rare earth elements from ores	Lanthanides form the majority of the highly important rare earth elements (REE) and possess outstanding catalytic and magnetic properties. REEs are essential in all fields of modern technology – from automobility to medical diagnostics. The current REE mining is energy-intense and relies on many synthesized chemicals. We developed a protein-based process to increase sustainability and selectivity of REE mining. The bacterial protein lanmodulin (LanM) was heterologously produced in E. coli and purified in a novel, chromatography-free one-step method. LanM was added to an ore leachate to form an REE-LanM complex. After isolation of this complex, REE ions were released by pH reduction. Upon removal of LanM, this biological chelator was regenerated and a highly pure REE solution was obtained. Our project is characterized by iterative process optimization tailoring the approach to industrial application. Overall, it was demonstrated that the protein LanM can replace current chemical chelating agents in REE mining.

4103	Open_Science_Global	Frugal Biofoundries for Distributed Enzyme Manufacturing	Biotechnology can help avert human civilization's looming mass extinction caused by fossil energy. However, intellectual property, skills, and high costs of hardware and wetware create massive barriers. These barriers were profoundly felt throughout the pandemic as sparse access to bio-manufacturing infrastructure severely limited medical relief, testing, and vaccination. With an internationally distributed team of 10 nationalities and 4 laboratories, we aim to break these barriers by frugally producing and purifying thermostable enzymes essential for synthetic biology solutions. We have established a pipeline for enzyme production in frugal bio-foundries that’s based on open-sourced software, hardware, material transfer agreement, and wetware constructs of B. subtilis for reducing protein extraction costs. Our genetic constructs will be freely distributed by FreeGenes. To gauge the global needs of implementing a frugal bio-foundry in different parts of the world, we set up a hackathon in partnership with JOGL.

4105	Yonsei_Korea	Detection of rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae using Cu2+ dependent DNAzymes and gold nanoparticles	Rice blast, a fungal disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is increasingly affecting rice plants leading to approximately 30% of rice production losses globally (Nailey 2016) and 15-60% annual incidents in Korea. The current treatment and diagnostic methods, however, are not environmentally friendly or are not easy to use for farmers. Therefore, we propose a DNAzyme based detection system to specifically detect the mif23 gene of M. oryzae. By Cu2+ catalyzation, our DNAzyme cleaves at the ends of the CTGC site of the target gene. We used PAGE and denaturing PAGE to validate the specific cleavage activity. We also confirmed that Cu2+ is significant in catalyzation, and that it is an efficient system in detecting the target gene. Lastly, gold nanoparticles functionalized with the complementary target DNA sequences to the cleaved DNA products were employed as a colorimetric approach to visualize the DNAzyme catalyzed cleavage reaction.

4118	Patras_Medicine	syn-PNOIA: Redefining Lung Cancer Diagnosis	Lung Cancer (LC) is the deadliest type of cancer worldwide. In 2020, WHO estimated 1.8 million deaths. This high mortality rate is caused by the late diagnosis of the disease since patients often do not get examined until the late stages. In addition, in the early stages, no severe symptoms arise. Thereby, we aspire to develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool based on Liquid Biopsies to target a panel of three circular RNAs (hsa_circ_070354, hsa_circ_0102533, hsa_circ_005962). Using Rolling Circle Amplification and fluorescent hairpin probes, we attempted to create a Linear DNA Nanostructure to identify and quantify the biomarkers in a complex blood sample in 70 minutes. Furthermore, we suggest applying our technique through modeling work in other disease diagnoses via different panels of circular RNAs as distinct biomarkers. Finally, as LC ascertains to be a leading cause of cancer death, we propose to implement our tool in people with increased risk.

To achieve this,we designed several systems. The first system uses L-amino acid oxidase fused to a high affinity peptide to gold. A byproduct of the oxidation is H2O2 which can be measured using a gold electrode. The second system is based on the conjugation of an amino acid to the appropriate tRNA synthetase that releases AMP. This reaction is coupled to an AMP aptamer-based sensor that releases ferrocene and can be measured by an electrode.

4123	Manchester	A bacterial companion to aid growth and lipid accumulation in microalgae	The production of renewable energy and efficient wastewater treatment are two pressing challenges globally. Our project addresses these issues. We will create an engineered bacterium that uses wastewater as a growth medium to produce and release auxin, an algal growth factor. When deployed in a co-culture system, the presence of these bacteria will allow microalgae to grow more efficiently on wastewater. Once sufficient algal biomass has been produced, the engineered bacteria can be triggered to move from an auxin-producing state to a phosphate-accumulating state, using a light-dependent genetic switch mechanism. This will lead to phosphate depletion in the medium and a transition of the microalgae from their active growth phase to a state of lipid accumulation (improved by phosphate starvation). Increased lipid accumulation can then be used to produce biodiesel. Our project could be the first step towards economically sustainable microalgal biofuel production to meet global energy demands.

They contaminate water resources during harmful algal blooms, posing severe threat to both ecological stability health. Upon drinking intake, the group 2B carcinogen causes liver failure and non-alcoholic liver cancer. We utilized microcystin degradation gene mlrA from natural bacteria Sphingopyxis sp.m6, and connected it with cross-membrane ice nucleation protein to construct an extracellular enzyme display system. Significant expression of MlrA was found on the surface of recombinant E. coli, whose biodegradation capability was verified.

4126	HK_CPU-WYY	Project SSS	Inspired by the production of insulin, we came up with the idea of producing abundant spider silk in order to utilize such wonderful materials to replace the current materials to enhance the quality of products and promote environmental protection by synthetic biology. In this project, we aim to engineer E.coli BL21 to produce a protein named spidroin, the basic unit of spider silk. Masp1, Masp2 and NT2RepCT are planned to be manufactured. Based on our modeling result, we have predicted the concentration of IPTG needed to make an ideal spider silk. In the future, the mechanical properties of silk products, like strength, will be adjusted by controlling the proportion of spidroin with different properties. Thus, we hope to obtain spidroin with different properties to cater to different needs, like as string of musical instruments or as bio-concrete to stabilize the collapsing buildings, hence providing alternative materials for other goods.

4128	BIT	Etiological classification system of chronic musculoskeletal pain based on miRNA biomarkers	Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is the most common chronic pain in clinical practice. The prevalence of CMP is increasing due to aging of the population and lifestyle changes. Low treatment and remission rate of CMP have reduced quality of life and caused a waste of medical resources. Accurate distinction between two origins of CMP, namely neuropathic and nociceptive, can help diagnosis and treatment. The expression of miRNAs is distinct in different types of CMP. Using HCR+CRISPR system and paper-based chips, we developed a programmable quantitative detection device for a variety of miRNAs. HCR is an enzyme-free isothermal nucleic acid amplification system. The downstream CRISPR/Cas12a system recognizes and cleaves the amplification products of HCR, generating fluorescence signals. Meanwhile, we designed a portable paper chip and incubator suitable for various application scenarios, and used smartphones to analyze the reaction results, and combined with the classification model, achieved pain classification and evaluation.

4129	DTU-Denmark	Engineering Aspergillus niger to detect and convert furfural from lignocellulosic waste	Large amounts of lignocellulosic wastes are generated from forestry and agriculture with substantial proportions being burned or dumped instead of being recycled. Nonetheless, lignocellulosic wastes have the potential to be used as a microbial carbon source in biorefineries of various chemicals, where especially the fungus Aspergillus niger has shown a lot of potential. However, the toxic compound furfural, commonly found in lignocellulosic waste, is greatly hampering the growth of A. niger, thereby limiting the applications of lignocellulosic waste in biorefineries. DTU Biobuilders is set to solve this problem. Using computational tools, we tuned synthetic transcription factors to detect furfural and subsequently activate the expression of heterologous furfural-degrading enzymes in A. niger. This could potentially improve A. niger growth in lignocellulosic waste, thereby unlocking the full potential of lignocellulosic waste as a sustainable carbon source in biorefineries.

4130	Rochester	Saptasense: Saving Syrup	The billion-dollar maple syrup industry produces syrup-based products with values 20 times that of crude oil. However, one in twenty gallons of syrup contains defects that make it unfit for human consumption. Defects include buddy syrup, which has a cabbage-like taste due to metabolic changes in the maple tree, and ropy syrup, which has a stringy texture due to bacterial contamination. These defects are only detected once the sap has been boiled into syrup, wasting valuable resources. Due to inefficient measurement standards, resources are also wasted when measuring glucose levels needed to produce ancillary products. In response, Team Saptasense has developed three sugarmaker-targeted tools to help alleviate financial and environmental costs of syrup and sap defects: a novel method for repurposing ropy syrup into dextran, a sensor kit that detects buddy sap before it is boiled into syrup, and a high-sensitivity glucometer that accurately shows producers precise syrup glucose levels.

In the aspect of healthy life, we encouraged people to exercise by holding campus walking and pop-up activities. In the aspect of healthy eat, we collaborated with other iGEM teams to establish the cookbook to decrease the intake of bad oil. To increase the intake of good oil, we generated a new source of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplement by synthetic biology. The EPA production was mediated by pfa genes from Moritella marina and Shewanella pneumatophori. We further applied Acc genes to increase the raw materials of EPA, and chemical cerulenin to inhibit the lipid products competing with EPA. Together, we believed that PACOmega project not only passively protect people from CVDs, but also actively help people to gain a healthy life.

4132	USAFA	Bioengineering and Optimization of Biocementation for Potential Space Applications (Sili Sand)	Mars is an exciting frontier that beckons exploration. While space technology enables expeditions to the red planet, dust clouds generated upon landing complicate missions and damage equipment. To mitigate dust, we aim to genetically engineer Escherichia coli for use in biocementation, a process that uses urease enzymes to initiate calcium carbonate precipitation to bind sand and particles into cement. Studies indicate that precipitating silica during biosilicification creates silica spheres that stabilize enzyme activity and provide UV protection. We hypothesize that silicification will stabilize urease enzymes and enable biocementation on extraterrestrial surfaces. Therefore, we seek to genetically engineer E. coli to express silicatein genes from sea sponges that will enable silica precipitation. We also aim to improve expression of functional urease enzyme from Sporosarcina pasteurii to generate functional urease activity in E. coli. Producing silica-stabilized urease enzymes (Sili Sand) will yield a sustainable, lightweight, biological solution for dust mitigation on Mars.	Biomanufacturing	Silver Medal			2022	J.

4136	Concordia-Montreal	The genetic engineering of cyanobacteria for the degradation of organophosphate pesticides in wastewater	With uses ranging from agricultural to industrial, organophosphates are some of the most commonly-used pesticides in the world. However, when these pesticides are improperly managed, they accumulate in wastewater, which may cause harm to human health, wildlife, and the surrounding environment. Moreover, current pesticide degradation methods—Fenton and Photo-Fenton treatments—are costly and unsustainable. Our bioremediation project seeks to use biological processes as an efficient and economic solution for the degradation of organophosphates. Using organophosphate hydrolases (opH and opdB), we aim to genetically engineer two strains of cyanobacteria (PCC 6803 and PCC 7942) to degrade Fenitrothion and Malathion. In order to prevent biocontainment breaches, a controlled cell death system was incorporated into our project. The kill switch is activated in the presence of residual pesticides and their by-products, ensuring that the GMO remains confined to a controlled environment.

Current solutions to Foc TR4 are insufficient to stop its global spread or to treat disease symptoms. To prevent devastation to the Cavendish banana, our project aims to engineer a B. subtilis biofungicidal rhizobacteria to provide persistent protection against Foc. By engineering SEC-mediated chitinase secretion, the bacteria would induce growth inhibition in Foc. We designed a malate-induced toxin-antitoxin biocontainment system that restricts the bacteria to the banana rhizosphere such that a protective barrier of bacteria is formed to ward off Foc. Beyond solving the specific crisis of bananas, our project serves to spearhead the application of genetic engineering to rhizobacteria as a means of buying time for the development of sustainable agricultural methods to save threatened crops.

4138	Aachen	MEtaPhos - Modified Enzymes targeting Phosphate-recycling	Phosphorous is an essential element of life. Regarding the decreasing rate of phosphate mining and the waste of phosphate in wastewater, there will soon not be enough to sustain a civilization of ten billion people. Up until now, there is no efficient solution to regain phosphate from wastewater. If humanity fails to recycle phosphate, we will have a wide range of challenges. One problem is the pollution of soils and water with high amounts of phosphate from agricultural and industrial waste. Furthermore, the need for phosphate fertilizers will only grow as the earth’s population grows. MEtaPhos aims to revolutionize the phosphate cycle by fusing a phosphate-binding protein with a molecular optogenetic switch. By blue light irradiation, we can control the binding and release of phosphate in a highly specific manner. Our goal is to recycle phosphate from wastewater and generate polyphosphate to be reused in the industry.

4139	Lethbridge	CyaNoMore	Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, are a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes that form blooms in bodies of water. In Alberta, many lakes are close to farms whose operations release nutrients such as phosphorus, which contribute to the proliferation of cyanobacteria. Overgrowth of harmful algal blooms (HAB) causes damage to aquatic ecosystems, primarily by oxygen consumption and cyanotoxin release during HAB decay. Microcystis aeruginosa (MC) produces the cyanotoxin microcystin–LR (MC–LR), which is toxic to animals if consumed. Chemical treatments, such as copper sulfate, cause off-target effects to lake organisms. Our objective is to utilize a CRISPR-Cas13a target-specific system contained in a phage-like particle to combat HAB. This system will control overgrowth of cyanoblooms without off-target effects. Furthermore, incorporating the microcystin-degrading enzyme mlrA in our genetic construct mitigates the dangers of MC-LR by peptide linearization. Overall, this provides a treatment method that tackles the harm due to cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems.

The diagnostic approach is achieved via Lateral Flow Assay which provides a cost-effective, accurate, and user-friendly test. We are introducing a novel consumption line in which aptamers-nanoparticles conjugates with pre-specified concentrations consume the normal level of phenylalanine in the sample. The designed aptamers are generated using our directed evolution software tool. Subsequently, the sample passes through the test line that contains a whole cell-based biosensor that releases beta-galactosidase enzyme, providing a semi-quantitative colorimetric signal. This approach uses a CRISPR-regulated therapeutic circuit to control the release of PAH. We introduce a novel Selective Endogenous eNcapsidation for cellular Delivery (SEND) of PAH.

One current limitation to the use of AMPs is that they are difficult to produce by chemical means. Therefore, we have addressed multi-drug resistance by developing a novel, efficient, and scalable method to produce protein-based antibiotics using encapsulins. Our system uses pH sensitive protein nanocompartments to selectively sequester antimicrobial peptides to mitigate toxicity to their host -- E. coli. We generated this system by designing a plasmid construct where an AMP is fused to an encapsulin-specific targeting peptide. Following expression, we extracted and digested the fusion protein to yield a purified antimicrobial peptide. We conclude that this is an inexpensive and scalable method to manufacture antimicrobial peptides that have the potential to supplement or replace current antibiotics, thereby addressing antibiotic resistance.

So our team aims to engineer the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, which has been demonstrated to reduce depression, to periodically generate a natural metabolite and antidepressant S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) in the gut. To enhance the antidepressant effect of Bifidobacterium longum, Sam2 and Pet8p, the synthetase and transporter of SAMe, respectively, were overexpressed. To mimic drug uptake behavior and regulate plasma concentration, the expression of Sam2 was controlled by an oscillator which is periodically activated. Meanwhile, to ensure safety, a temperature-sensitive redundant kill switch kills the engineered probiotic when it exits human digestive tract, and an AHL-induced kill switch allows the bacteria to be eliminated by AHL ingestion when no longer needed.

4149	Jiangnan-China	Construction of acid-tolerant Escherichia coli chassis cells based on membrane key factor CFAs from extremophiles Acidithiobacillus caldus	Acid stress conditions are frequently encountered during industrial fermentation as a consequence of the accumulation of acidic metabolites, which calls for more efficient and cost-effective acid-tolerant strains. However, bioleaching microbes have such superb acid resistance that they can thrive in the extremely acidic environment of bioleaching solution. Acidithiobacillus caldus shows the most outstanding ability to resist acid stress. Through a series of literature review and previous experiment, we studied cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (CFAs) gene, the core acid-resistant element of A. caldus, and designed a promoter modification strategy, which was successfully applied in E. coli to improve the acid resistance of chassis cells. In addition, our Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can help to identify ?38 dependent promoters in different strains.

4150	Mingdao	Phaccine - a bacteriophage-based vector for safer vaccine	Emerging pandemics like COVID-19 need instant effective vaccines. Currently, the most successful vaccines are equipped in liposome or adenovirus vectors, which are delivered intravenously into human body. Antigen proteins produced through human-self cells trigger immune responses. For immediate use, the protein target from a less-known pathogen to be determined may be physiologically toxic to human cells. Commensal bacteria are normal flora living in humans. What if the antigen gene being transferred into them? Could the antigen protein be produced and be effective to induce immune responses? In our project, we engineered a T7 bacteriophage with a model antigen (ovalbumin) gene. The isolated intestinal E. coli were tested susceptible to the phages and can produce the antigen proteins. We created a model of phage vector - commensal bacteria - antigen production. Based on clinical phage therapy procedure, we are planning to conduct animal studies to examine the effectiveness for phage vaccine.

4151	CSMU_Taiwan	AID can aid	With higher awareness of animal rights, more and more people in recent years are advocating for animal welfare, such as gradually eliminating experimental animals. For example, non-animal-derived antibodies have thus been developed to replace animal-derived antibodies. However, this replacement may lead to the enormous waste of hybridomas, the main manufacturers of animal-derived antibodies. Besides, there are still many problems relating to non-animal-derived antibodies. Therefore, CSMU_Taiwan devise a win-win solution based on optimizing the hybridoma technology. We hope to reduce animal use while simultaneously retaining the advantages of animal-derived antibodies.

4152	TJUSLS_China	Capsid ripper! Rational designed mutated Proteinase K with ultra thermostability at RT	As a broad spectrum protease, Proteinase K has extremely high enzyme activity and extensive substrate specificity, which is widely used in various fields. Proteinase K is used in nucleic acid extraction to degrade the protein and promote the release of nucleic acid. However, its easy self-degradation and poor stability at room temperature limit its large-scale application. Supported by extensive computer modeling, we applied a series of rational protein engineering strategies to rationally design Proteinase K to enhance its stability. A variety of software and modeling methods including autodock vina and gromacs were used to superimpose and screen multiple mutation points, experimental verification was carried out in the laboratory. Our project makes it possible to use and transport Proteinase K at room temperature, and greatly reduces the cost of using Proteinase K. We are actively seeking commercialization possibilities to expand the impact of our projects and bring benefits to more people.

4153	THINKER_CHINA	LysTech DETR, a pioneering chromogenic detection system	The primary detection methods are effective but are expensive and require heavy machines with complex operations. Therefore, we, THINKER_CHINA, with biosensors as our core, are working on designing a better, cheaper, more efficient detection module and reporting module that can be market-oriented. Our biosensor is essentially based on the high specificity of E coli’s operons and the function of SRRz lysis gene. SRRz is a kind of gene extracted from phages, and the expression of which has the effect of lysing the bacterial cell wall. Bacterial endogenous ß-galactosidase can catalyze the chromogenic reaction of the colorless substrate x-gal. The chromogenic reaction demonstrates a clear pattern of different greyscale values, positively correlated with the intensity of SRRz gene expression. And this operon-induced expression is correlated with the intensity of the objective factors, so different concentrations of the factors result in different greyscale values.

4154	CityU_HongKong	Development of novel anticancer drug candidates: applying synthetic biology in improved fungal natural product biosynthesis	Natural products (NPs) have always been a vital source of anticancer medicines. However, NPs exist in complex mixtures, and their modification is typically hindered by complicated chemical structures. The team “SeCure” aims to apply synthetic biology to the fungal biosynthesis of secalonic acids (SADs), leading to the controllable production of novel bioactive substances. We constructed an artificial biosynthetic pathway by modifying the natural biosynthesis of SAD via the replacement of a short-chain dehydrogenase gene with the gene from the biosynthetic pathway of neosartorin. The engineered pathway was expressed in the fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The isolated metabolites revealed high efficacy against colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. In silico modelling showed that their anticancer potency was linked to their ability to bind human topoisomerase I. As a result of this iGEM project, several team members received an entrepreneurial grant of HK$100,000 to develop this idea into a startup.

4156	LZU-CHINA	Targeted Treatment of Colorectal Cancer with Gene-Editing Probiotics	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies, according to the WHO GLOBOCAN database. Current treatments for colorectal cancer include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy etc. However, the biggest challenge of these therapies is the indiscriminate killing of normal cells. The environment in which tumor cells live is usually characterized by high lactate concentration, low pH and hypoxia. LZU-CHINA takes advantage of this characteristic by introducing three promoters into the probiotic, equipping the strain with an automated tumor targeting system. In order to make the system stable and enhance the specificity of the engineered microbe to kill tumor cells, we also added other genetic components including amplifying genetic logic gate, adhesion factor, killing factor and lysis factor. 2022 LZU-CHINA is dedicated to provide new approaches and ideas for cancer therapy by synthetic biology through gene circuit optimization and construction.

The main targeted stakeholder was women undergoing fertility treatment. Fertility treatment method with higher success rate is strongly desired particularly in Japan with declining birthrate and increasing late-life marriages. This issue is also expected to be serious in other developed countries. The primary goal was to detect two types of female hormones, progesterone and estrogen in the cell-free system. In addition, as for the outputs, we devised a small household sensing device, and a capsule treatment device designed to be driven in uterus. The function of the devices were investigated thorough dry lab modeling. The compatibility of the devised sensors for other substances was also investigated.

They often arise as a secondary complication of more persistent health problems. Biofilms are present around 80% of chronic wounds and contribute to their slowed healing. Our project, QBlock, is intended to limit biofilm formation by targeting bacterial communication molecules (i.e. AIPs) that contribute to biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis by impeding the bacterial communication via DARPins (designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), which are synthetic proteins mimicking antibodies. A DNA library of 42 DARPins was generated by altering and randomizing amino acid positions. AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and the affinity of DARPins towards AIP was experimentally measured via ribosomal display. Control experiments employed a GFP-binding DARPin with a known sequence. Structural predictions and modeling not only confirmed a significant binding with AIP, but also highlighted the diversity and heterogeneity of DARPins."

4160	TU-Eindhoven	Designing a modular and personalized autoimmune cell therapy for ANCA-associated vasculitis	Worldwide 400 million people suffer from autoimmune diseases, of which 1 million are affected by the inflammatory disorder ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Current therapies against AAV are based on unspecific immunosuppressive drugs causing burdensome side effects, high healthcare expenditures and workloads, while not excluding disease relapses. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed !MPACT: a Modular and Personalized Autoimmune Cell Therapy. The design was made together with relevant stakeholders, a proof-of-concept was developed in the laboratory, and a kinetic model was built. We engineered mammalian cells that detect the autoantibodies (ANCAs) and subsequently produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, which results in suppression of the autoimmune response. The activity of !MPACT depends on the ANCA concentration, hence, it adjusts to the disease activity, leading to fewer side effects than current therapies, preventing relapses, and reducing healthcare expenditures and workloads. The modularity of the used technology offers great potential to treat many autoimmune diseases.

4167	ICJFLS	Dawnlight Saga: A Portable Detector for MDD Based on Toehold Switch and Cell Free System	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common chronic psychological disease, resulting in heavy family and social burdens. However, current diagnosis of MDD is mainly based on the patients' description of symptoms, assessment of mental status and evaluation of clinical behaviors, which increase the rate of misdiagnosis. Developing the biomarkers and effective diagnosis method of MDD remains a challenge. Here we report the development of a novel, inexpensive, and portable filter-paper-based biosensor, which can be used to diagnose MDD patients by detecting the abundance of specific microRNA in blood. This biosensor comprises nucleic-acid toehold switches designed to bind to the identified differentially expressed biomarker miRNAs in MDD, namely miR-34a-5p, miR-221-3p and let-7d-3p. Each toehold switch requires a biomarker miRNA-antimiRNA complex to trigger the expression of a marker protein, which could be easily measured. The developed switches may be embedded in a composite biosensor to yield a paper-based device for detecting MDD.

To avoid high transportation risk caused by radiation, iGEM NCKU_Tainan provides MerSe as a state-of-art solution by synthesis biology to protect bacteria or cells from radiation exposure. Being able to produce selenomelanin using the 21st amino acid selenocysteine and melanin, Se coli shows superior radiation resistance. To further apply Se coli as a bio-factory, we produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) alongside selenomelanin.

4173	NJU-China	Treatment of Alopecia by Genetically Engineered Small Extracellular Vesicles (sEV)	Alopecia is a skin disorder occurs in a wide population, often causing damaging psychological consequences. The NJU-China iGEM team chose to focus on androgenetic alopecia (AGA), which exhibits the highest prevalence. Current drugs on the market for treating AGA produce unstable results and cause various side effects. Our team began with a comprehensive study of its molecular mechanism then selected several genetic targets. Our goal was to develop a drug with minimal side effects, stable results, and ease of use. On the one hand, we applied RNAi technique and mRNA embedding elements to regulate gene expression particularly. On the other hand, we used sEV (extracted by Tangential Flow Filtration and bind-elute size exclusion chromatography) and microneedles to carry and deliver siRNA and mRNA to follicle cells. Furthermore, apart from AGA, our research may also pave the way for an sEV-mediated systemic delivery platform of therapeutic cargo for other dermatologic diseases.

4174	William_and_Mary	ChassEASE: Data-Driven Chassis Selection for Fieldable Synthetic Biology	To address the broadest array of global problems, synthetic biology will need to move beyond the laboratory and into the field. However, multiple barriers impede the deployment of fieldable systems in soil, water, or living tissues. One initial barrier is selecting an optimal and safe chassis for a specific environment. While computational tools provide data-driven predictions to inform other aspects of the synthetic biology design process, mathematical models and associated software to assist with chassis selection for a specific environment are lacking. To meet this need, the W&M iGEM team designed a predictive model using multivariate regression and neural networks to help scientists with chassis selection for soil, water, air, and the gut microbiome. Based on input type, our software predicts the optimal chassis for a specific environment or the most favorable environment for a predetermined chassis, leading to safer, more effective, fieldable, and robust genetic circuits.

4175	ZJUintl-China	Ambrosia-T	Massive cellular senescence is accompanied by the onset of various age-related diseases leading to irreversible aging. Previous studies have demonstrated that removal of senescent cells can reverse aging. Tissue fibrosis is a aging hallmark, characterized by senescent fibroblasts. Furthermore, based on single-cell data analysis and immunochemistry, DPP4 were highly expressed on the surface of aged fibroblasts rather than on young fibroblasts. To address the concerns and reverse senescence-associated phenotypes, we designed a novel and efficient system for removal of these senescent fibroblasts with the help of assembled DPP4-targeting CAR-T immunotherapy. Due to the side effects of CAR-T system, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), we have also designed a negative feedback circuit with detecting the concentration of IL-6, markers of CRS. With the constant function of our project, anti-aging CAR-T, the harmful senescent fibroblasts are eradicated without severe side effects and the grand vision of rejuvenating with one shot will be realized.

4176	DUT_China	Strainer - A purification system enable high efficient CRISPR-based genome engineering during cell factory construction	CRISPR/Cas system has been successfully harnessed for programmable RNA-guided genome editing in many fields. But CRISPR-based genome engineering strategies have off-target cleaves, variable gRNA efficiency, protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificity and other problems. These hinder us obtaining strains that are accurately edited, prolonging the time of strain construction and screening, costing more manpower and materials. Here, we developed a CRISPR-based purification system “strainer”, which utilizes double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) as a signal to start the transcription of gRNA targeting on the plasmid harboring inducible toxic gene SacB. Then, only the strain with DSBs and recombineering can survive in the media with sucrose, because SacB converts sucrose to levan that is toxic to E. coli, thereby improving the overall editing efficiency during the genome engineering process. We then applied “strainer” for an isopropanol high-producing strain construction efficiently. “Strainer” can be potentially used as an universal method for cell factory construction.

4179	Technion-Israel	Angel Roots: From plants to bacterial cells, biomanufacturing decursin to treat chemotherapy-induced alopecia	Angelica Gigas is a plant well known in Asia for its medicinal properties, which are attributed to decursin. Decursin was identified as a novel agent for the treatment of many medical conditions, as well as a promising candidate for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (hair loss), one of the most distressing side effects for cancer patients. Nowadays, decursin is expensive and inaccessible due its low-yielding and polluting extraction, alongside the seasonal nature of the plant. To address this issue, we chose to bio-manufacture decursin in bacteria. We designed a synthetic circuit encoding for three enzymes that catalyze the two penultimate reactions in the anabolic pathway. This will make the production of decursin cheap and sustainable and enable therapeutic applications to be further explored. Finally, we engineered a biosensor that could quantify decursin. This can be used by future teams that investigate molecules that affect the Hippo signaling pathway.

4185	MSP-Maastricht	Aestuarium - A Strategy for the Use of Photosynthetic Bacteria in Water Treatment	Droughts and water shortages are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Accordingly, our team had to design a novel method of water desalination to solve the ongoing challenge of water scarcity, building on earlier efforts. Current desalination systems use fossil fuels, an expensive process that emits greenhouse gases. Our strategy is to create an energy-efficient solution. We accomplish this by genetically altering marine cyanobacteria to take up more salt. The NpHR pump is responsible for Cl- removal, and we went one step further by adding a pH-dependent antiporter in charge of Na+ absorption. The pump's activity is controlled by green light, and our strains are enclosed in beads to offer a biocontainment system. Relying on our models, we demonstrate that our modified cyanobacteria can desalinate with minimal energy use. Hence, industries and water management firms have shown great interest in the project, generating new prospects for water security.

The innovative microbial fuel cell goal is to both store energy and to produce electricity by using spent grain as its sole power source. Eventually, StarchLight wants to provide brewers a solution to reduce their carbon footprint while getting rid of the unwanted waste they generate. The StarchLight device relies on two bacterial strains: Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Shewanella oneidensis (S.oneidensis). To use spent grain as a power source, we designed a system based around the genetic engineering of E.coli: it degrades the starch in spent grain into lactate, stores it intracellularly as polylactate, and delivers lactate on-demand to S.oneidensis. S. oneidensis can then use the lactate to produce electricity by means of chain electron transfers in its inner membrane.

4188	WWU_Muenster	MonChassis - Monoterpenoid production in yeast coupled with cell-free monooxygenase catalysation	Monoterpenoids are versatile biomolecules with broad applications in healthcare, agriculture, and consumer products. However, large-scale applications remain rare, as traditional production methods rely on extraction from plants and chemical synthesis. This makes monoterpenoid production expensive and unsustainable. Microbial production of monoterpenoids is a promising alternative, but poor precursor availability, complicated expression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), and product toxicity limit their potential. MonChassis is overcoming current limitations by increasing precursor availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica by metabolic engineering, compartmentalization, and creating a cell-free, electrically-driven CYP system to circumvent product toxicity. With this, we established an adaptable platform for monoterpenoid production, allowing further deployment of monoterpenoids in unexplored areas. As a proof-of-concept , we produced verbenone, used to fight bark beetle invasion in forests locally, and globally. Thereby, MonChassis not only establishes a flexible production method for monoterpenoids without using plants but also contributes to the conservation of forests.

4193	OUC-China	DISP-Directional Intelligent Screening Platform	Nowadays, strain quality has become a major factor limiting the yield of fermentation industry. The engineering bacteria degenerate into wild-type due to mutation or some unknown endogenous regulation. They have more growth advantages than the production engineering bacteria and gradually occupy resources to become the dominant species. The production genes introduced into the engineering bacteria are copied and lost in the process of DNA replication during cell proliferation. At the same time, some products accumulate in the engineering bacteria, which has a negative feedback regulation effect on the production of enzymes. Moreover, the extraction process of the products by breaking the engineering bacteria is very complicated. We plan to design a software and hardware platform that automatically regulates the production and screening of strains to extract product simply to ensure high-quality strains and improve the fermentation yield.

Also, a rapid detection method is in urgent need. Therefore, XMU-China offers OMEGA. It includes detection, treatment and prevention of AHPND. First, Recombinase Polymerase Amplification technology and cell-free system are employed to detect toxin genes in the water sample. Then engineered outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are applied to target and deliver plasmids encoding endolysin into the pathogen, treating the disease. For prevention, OMVs with surface displayed receptors are further used to competitively bind to the PirA/PirB, preventing cell damage. CRISPR/Cas system is further utilized to destroy pirA/pirB gene, achieving the virulence loss of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

4197	Toulouse_INSA-UPS	DAISY : find out everything you could be allergic to!	Due to multi-environnemental factors, allergies have been a rising problem over the last decades and even our team members are at risk. Today, the number of detected allergens is still limited, resulting in undiagnosed allergies. Our project proposes an innovative approach to detect Immunoglobulins E (IgE) in the patient’s blood and so, the predisposition to any allergy. This method is based on the specific aggregation of engineered Escherichia coli strains in presence of IgE. We produced the strains, modeled interactions and used state-of-the-art technologies for high-throughput screening. While there is still room for optimization, the method is a major step towards detection of any allergy and the production of custom-made treatments. We identified that patients and their relatives seldomly know what allergies are about. So, we engaged in a deep educational effort including a series of videos named “Cracking Allergies”, as it is what we firmly intend to do!

By introducing double plasmids into EcN, ChuA(heme transporter), HrtR(Lactococcus heme reactive transcription inhibitor), promoter HrtO and pigment genes were introduced into engineering probiotics. By taking probiotics to act on the intestines, when there is a small amount of intestinal bleeding, ChuA will transport the heme in the intestines to E. coli and combine with hrtr to affect the transcription and expression of the hrto promoter, and express the pigment gene . Finally, detect whether there is pigment to determine whether there is trace bleeding.

4200	MIT_MAHE	AMPifin	Vibriosis is a bacterial disease primarily observed in marine, estuarine, and occasionally, freshwater fish. It is caused by the bacteria of the genus Vibrio and is a significant reason for mortality in pisciculture operations. Among this species, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the most prevalent pathogens. The problem remains substantial despite the pre-existing solutions like antibiotics, vaccines, and over-the-counter medicines. For this reason, we intend to design a sustainable alternative to them by synthesising an antimicrobial peptide that will bind to the Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7 (MAM7)—a surface protein present on the bacteria. MAM7 is responsible for bacterial adhesion to the host's epithelial cells, triggering the infection. Hence, by inhibiting adhesion, the infection will be prevented in its primary stage, consequently rendering the bacteria harmless to the fish. Our peptide would be synthesised by our chassis—BL21, and delivered using chitosan nanoparticles.

4201	CU-Boulder	Magic Beans: Finding Environmental Solutions for Chemotherapeutic Cultivation in Soybeans	The chemotherapeutic Paclitaxel is listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization and is one of the most intensively used anti-tumor drugs. Unfortunately, Paclitaxel is difficult to obtain and produce, with one dose requiring the harvest of six old-growth Pacific Yew trees. The development of complete and semi-complete chemical syntheses have improved extraction efforts, but production is still inefficient and expensive. The CU-Boulder iGEM Team is engineering a system in soybeans to produce Paclitaxel to increase the accessibility of this essential chemotherapeutic while decreasing the environmental impact of producing Paclitaxel. The paclitaxel precursor taxadiene can be synthesized in soybeans by genetically integrating enzymes that are naturally found in the Yew Tree. Soybeans can be easily farmed and are the most common genetically modified crop in the world.

In order to overcome the challenges in restoring tiny cracks, ZJU-China is dedicated to developing technologies for the integrated conservation of stone artifacts based on engineered Bacillus subtilis induced biomineralization. Extracellular calcium carbonate precipitates are brought in for filling the tiny cracks of stone artifacts, with an extracellular scaffold system to further improve the physicochemical properties of the materials. We have also added a quorum sensing module and a biosafety module to make our materials environmentally friendly and efficient.

Current detection methods including PCR-based tests are expensive and require specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we aim to develop an alternative detection method based on a B. cereus-specific endolysin (LysPBC5), ATP sensor, and the one-HOur Low-cost Multipurpose highly Efficient System (HOLMES). These two systems will be assembled by mixing purified LysPBC5 and Cas12b to form an efficient B. cereus test kit. To lower the cost of protein purification, we employed Pro-QC and crystal violet inducible protein expression system by reducing incomplete transcripts and the cost of inducer.

Emerging evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the development of ASD. Our project, Engine of Starlight, aims at alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction to treat ASD and comprises three systems that go from assessment to treatment. The first is a biosensor sensitive to lactic acid levels for mitochondrial dysfunction detection, while the other two are probiotics engineered to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing NAD+ expression and preventing heavy metal accumulation in cells.

As plant infections can rarely be visualized at early phases of plant-pathogen encounter, we sought to devise a bioassay kit that could identify an infection before phenotypic symptoms arise. For this purpose we developed a low-cost cell-free system to be used on-site, based on exchangeable toehold switches that respond to pathogen-specific gene sequences. As a demonstration, we built a novel toehold switch for detecting barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), and compiled a library of alternative switches towards other pathogens to showcase system modularity. Reporter plasmids harboring the BYDV toehold switch were successfully constructed, and the reporter protein expression without the toehold was shown to work in a cell-free system. Although the function of the toehold-reporter combinations could not be verified, several iterations of system testing allowed us to pinpoint critical issues for the next steps of the assay development.

The current detection methods are laborious and require expensive chromatography and mass spectrometry equipment. This why in our project we aimed to develop an E.coli biosensor for a cheaper and easier detection of Anatoxin-a. We created a hybrid chemoreceptor which upon binding of the ligand induces the expression of GFP in the engineered E.coli. A plate reader can then be used to detect this signal.

Its damages include pipes clogging, inducing millions of Swiss francs of costs in Switzerland, and altering the local ecosystems of Swiss lakes. Our project aims to stop the spread of this species in two ways: by overexpressing the FitD toxin which has molluscicide and insecticides properties, naturally produced by Pseudomonas protegens. Then by engineering Escherichia coli to produce zosteric acid, an antifoulant compound that will prevent mussels’ attachment to surfaces. We successfully created plasmids expressing enzymes for zosteric acid production. They are now ready for testing and optimization. We also cloned several constructs to overexpress FitD. In our experiments with the mussels, we demonstrated that our engineered bacteria can indeed kill the mussels and we identified the most potent construct. Our results promise an efficient and ecological way to address the quagga mussel’s invasion.

However, they are toxic to bees and run-off from fields poisons fish and aquatic invertebrates. Here we report the successful development of a cheap in-field biosensor for lambda-cyhalothrin based on aptamer technology which produces an easy-to-read colour change. We demonstrated our biosensor’s target could be extended to fenitrothion, a second pesticide, with only minor changes. To enhance pyrethroid breakdown, we engineered a whole cell catalyst utilising a carboxylesterase from Bacillus velezensis. To improve activity and improve membrane insertion, we linked the carboxylesterase to a modified anchor protein isolated from Pseudomonas syringae. To explore growth-production trade-offs we developed an ordinary differential equation model of microbial gene expression and growth. Working under guidance from farmers and other stakeholders, we developed a spatial model to enable the optimisation of potential deployment strategies in the field.

Relying on the epithelium and basal tissue of their own wound margins, severe wounds and chronic wounds such as extensive burns and venous ulcers are difficult to heal. Tissue engineering scaffolds have great advantages in repairing skin wounds. The excellent properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) make it to be qualified as a high-quality tissue engineering scaffold. However, cellulose is non-degradable in vivo, which is a knotty problem that restricts its application at present. BCAID provides a solution in synthetic biology for the real application of BC tissue engineering scaffolds in human body, which is of great significance for repairing skin tissue wounds. BCAID is divided into basic BC production module, healing promoting module, blue-light activated BC degradation module and red-light activated engineered fibroblast(BJ) suicide module.

4212	Imperial_College_London	Sporadicate: a broad-spectrum biofungicide based on Bacillus subtilis spores	Over the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand more food than has ever been produced in human history. A major source of yield loss are fungal pathogens, constituting 75% of all plant diseases. Current solutions are falling short, with farmers relying on unselective spraying of fungicides due to delayed emergence of visible symptoms, often missing the early stages of infection when treatment is most effective. We propose Sporadicate, a broad-spectrum biofungicide based on Bacillus subtilis spores that eliminates the time-lag between diagnosis and treatment. Our bacterial spores are engineered to display chitinase enzymes on the surface, which degrade the cell wall of pathogenic fungi. This generates a biomarker that can be detected via a modified receptor – enabling spores to selectively germinate into vegetative cells exhibiting biocontrol properties. Given the innate durable properties of spores, our system would be robust, easily storable, widely applicable, and cost-effective.

4213	Thessaly	Navanthus: A monitoring and phytoremediation system against eutrophication	The Thessalian plain was one of the most fertile valleys of ancient Greece. Today, its intensive exploitation has led to the eutrophication of both Lake Karla and the Pinios River. Inorganic phosphate accumulation in water causes the formation of harmful algal blooms that produce cyanotoxins, leading to aquatic ecosystem deterioration. Our team aims to develop a universal monitoring and phytoremediation approach for eutrophic waters. The monitoring system will evaluate the ecological status of the water body and, wherever it indicates critical levels of eutrophication, a constructed floating wetland (CFW) will be implemented. The CFW will be made of biodegradable mycelium carrying genetically engineered plants. Once plant roots detect cyanotoxins via a novel synthetic riboswitch, they will overexpress PHT1 transporters that will enhance phosphate uptake. Plant shoots and leaves will stand over the CFW and will be eventually harvested and converted into fertilizer.

4214	Stockholm	B12-intake Gastric Intrinsic Factor (BiGIF): Treating Pernicious Anaemia	Pernicious Anaemia (PA) is an autoimmune disease that causes vitamin B12 deficiency which lacks efficient treatment. Patients with PA develop autoantibodies against Intrinsic Factor (IF) or IF-producing parietal cells.. Both of these types result in malabsorption of dietary B12 and result in B12 deficiency in the long term. Currently, high dosage B12 is administered to patients intravenously, intramuscularly and to a lesser extent orally, to circumvent malabsorption. Our solution aims to treat PA with a protein therapeutic consisting of an engineered IF which has phenotype-improving mutations in the autoantibody-binding epitope. Successful mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and were surface displayed in mammalian cells to validate the autoantibody and B12 binding. In the future, we are aiming to offer our treatment in the form of pills which include IF bound to B12 for optimised absorption of vitamin B12 and thus, increasing the quality of life for the patients.

Despite the increase in manganese discharges from industrial runoffs and the resulting increase in manganese contamination of water sources, applications for the detection and bioremediation of manganese are not widely available, cost-effective, or easy to maintain. We are developing an E.coli expressed biosensor for the detection of manganese contamination in water samples. The sensor consists of a manganese-responsive promoter and riboswitch driving expression of a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). The sensor is currently capable of detecting manganese down to 1mM, and efforts are underway to increase its sensitivity. Once the system is optimized, we plan to replace sfGFP with phytochelatin as a means of chelating manganese from drinking water. It is our hope that our system will provide a cost-effective and fieldable alternative to existing means of manganese detection and removal.

4218	YiYe-China	Detecting dysregulation of RNA splicing for myelodysplastic syndromes diagnosis using RNA splicing sensors	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the commonest hematologic malignancies in the elderly. Now, the accurate diagnosis of MDS still heavily rely on the experienced hematologists’ morphological evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more effective detection methods for MDS diagnosis. Aberrant splicing is strongly associated with MDS. Many RNA splicing-related genes have been found to mutate in around 50% of MDS patients, suggesting analysis of RNA splicing status should be used for diagnosis of MDS. It is reported that exons of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFN91) were skipped in MDS patients. This inspired us of constructing sensors fused the skipping exons into the plasmids containing reporter, which monitors the alteration of RNA splicing in cells. Our project provides a simple and effective method for early diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in MDS in the future.

Commonly, delivery vehicles are used to target cells according to cellular membrane characteristics, but such methods have many limitations, including insufficient specificity. A switch module on the 5’ UTR of the mRNA that senses and responds to a specific endogenous RNA trigger in the target cell, can be used in parallel to enhance specificity. To date, such a switch module has been used successfully in prokaryotes, including by many IGEM teams, but not in eukaryotes, and tools to design them efficiently are lacking.

4220	NEU_CHINA	RTAC, ready for cancer attack.	RSPOs (R-spondins) belong to a family of secreted proteins that was the leading cause of various cancers. In iGEM2022, NEU_CHINA team focused on developing a novel cancer targeted-therapy against all RSPOs. We originally designed and characterized a chimeric protein RTAC (RSPO-Targeting Anti-cancer Chimeric protein) through protein engineering. RTAC showed satisfactory anti-cancer effect through inhibition of RSPO-mediated Wnt/?-catenin signaling activation. For further improvement, a S.Cerevisiae-based probiotic was engineered, named as R-yeast, to deliver RTAC to RSPO-hyperactivated colorectal cancer locally. The mating pathway of R-yeast was reprogrammed to specifically sense the tumor environment-specific molecules, thus expressing RTAC in a self-tunable manner. Meanwhile, a unique copper-dependent kill switch was implanted to avoid R-yeast from causing potential environmental hazard. Collectively, we have presented the proof-of-concept of a novel anti-pan-RSPO protein and a probiotic with self-controllable machineries for cancer targeted treatment. Our work thus promises great value in synthetic biological research and translational medicine.

4221	BJEA_China	A polular deteriorated cheese —— BslA	Hydrophobins are small surface-active amphiphilic proteins that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas on their surface. They can self-assemble to form a stable film at the interface of both polar and non-polar solution phases. Thanks to high surface activity and amphiphilicity, Hydrophobins have broad application prospects as surfactants in interface engineering, emulsifiers in food processing, bioimmobilization agents in nanotechnology, and powerful protein purification tags in biotechnology. Our project features BslA, a bacterial-origin hydrophobin with great potential and wide application in synthetic biology. BslA is much easier to produce compared to their fungal-origin cousins, which overcomes the limitations of their industrial use. We hope to unleash the potential of BslA and solve some of the major concerns of the synbio community and humanity as a whole. To this end, Our team designed three BslA fusion proteins that target three problems: protein purification, antibiotic abuse, and plastic pollution.

4223	HainanU_China	NATer—— Nucleic acids tracker	"Since the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1929, antibiotic research has developed rapidly and the large-scale use of antibiotics has brought about serious problems of microbial resistance. Combined with human activities, the cross-species and cross-habitat spread of drug-resistant microorganisms and antibiotic-resistant genes occurred at the""Human-marine animal-environment"" interface. Antibiotics and their metabolites were enriched in the environment, spread to human by marine animals and animal products, produced drug-resistant microorganisms and caused the spread of drug-resistant genes,which has been a serious impact on human health. At present, there is no rapid detection instrument in the field of marine environmental monitoring to characterize microbial resistance in seawater. Based on the combination of CRISPR/CAS system and CSM6 protein, we identify mutagenic genes with single-base precision,detect specific drug-resistant genes in marine microorganisms and develop a platform for rapid detection of drug resistance in marine microorganisms."

4224	SMS_Shenzhen	?-galactase genetic engineering modification	Lactose intolerance indicates intestinal discomfort caused by decreased beta-galactosidase to digest lactose. Since lactase hydrolyses lactose into glucose and galactose, when the expression of lactase declines due to genetic disorder or natural ageing, the amount of lactose people can tolerate will decrease. It is a worldwide health problem that about 70% of the world population suffered from lactose intolerance. Notably, the incidence is particularly high in Asia because the downward trend of expressing lactase is strengthened by diets rarely containing lactose. In the dairy industry, Aspergillus oryzae is one of the most widely used fungal sources of beta-galactosidase (lacA) to produce lactose-free products for people with lactose intolerance. To allow people with lactose intolerance to enjoy dairy products, our project aims to express lacA heterologously in Pichia pastoris, quantify the enzymatic property of lacA, and optimise the culture conditions of recombined Pichia pastors.

4225	HKUST	Fisherly: Safe Fish on Your Dish	Fresh seafood products are highly susceptible to spoilage, so it is important to monitor their quality throughout storage and delivery. We aim to create a colorimetric biosensor that detects bioamine levels in raw fish, as high levels of bioamines signify the degradation of meat quality and cause bioamine poisoning. Our circuit detects the bioamine levels by converting them into H2O2 with rat diamine oxidase. H2O2 subsequently oxidizes the transcription factor OxyR, activating the katG promoter, which drives the expression of a red output. Essentially, the system turns green if the fish is safe to consume and red when it is spoiled. We use an E. coli-based cell-free system as the detection mechanism in our biosensor and a swab test will be done for extracting the final sample by users. Compared to current products, our biosensor will be a more ready-to-use, intuitive, and robust indicator of fresh fish quality.

Most oral problems can be preventable and treated in their early stages, especially for the universal tooth decay deduced by Streptococcus mutans. This project is seeking a low-cost and convenient way to prevent oral diseases by developing oral probiotics based on GRAS strain-Bacillus subtilis. With introduction of quorum sensing system from S. mutans, the switch of our designed genetic circuits would be triggered by sensing competence-stimulating peptide (CSP, quorum sensing signaling molecule with concentration positively correlated with the number of S. mutans).Our Healthy Teeth Legion project designed multiple genetic circuits to achieve the purpose of detecting oral hygiene and preventing dental caries, as well as achieving convenient feedback of test results. For safety reasons, termination switch has been added accordingly. With combination of scientific research, computer modeling and extensive experimental data,more reliable and convenient Healthy Teeth Legion would be developed.

4228	Tongji_China	Bplant: A Microbial Cell Factory that Produces Bromelain of High Quality	Bromelain is a plant protease which has a variety of properties, including anti-cancer activity, anti-inflammatory effect, antimicrobial effect, antibiotic potentiation, skin protection, postsurgery recovery and so on. It has a wide range of applications in the medical and food fields. Even though bromelain has great application potential, the traditional production process has issues of inefficiency, unstable source and low enzyme activity. Bplant replaced the traditional technique by synthetic biology and improved both enzymatic activity and stability by directed evolution. In the filed of fodder processing, bromelain can transform protein in feed into polypeptides and small peptides that are easy for animals to digest and absorb. It brings a variety of benefits like improving feed conversion efficiency, enhancing animal disease resistance and reducing the use of antibiotics as antibiotic substitute. In this application scenario, we hope to use Bacillus subtilis as bromelain production plant for safety consideration.

4229	Freiburg	chAMBER - Tidying up bacterial cells with natural and engineered nanocompartments	Despite their small size, bacteria have sophisticated and dynamic internal organization, featuring distinct microenvironments optimized for a given task, such as carboxysomes that perform CO2 fixation. We aimed to engineer and compare different compartmentalization systems (rigid shells and liquid droplets) for their ability to localize enzymes and promote metabolic processes due to reduced formation of toxic side-products and more efficient interplay between pathway components thanks to physical proximity. Using computational structural biology, we predicted sites at which the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) could influence pore size. To facilitate the use of ncAAs for future iGEM teams, we developed INCLUSIVE, a database collecting the important information from the literature. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of genome reduction on compartment formation and metabolic pathway output. In conclusion, our project lays the foundations for using compartmentalization as a tool to exploit the full power of bacterial cells.

But this promising drug delivery system has no effect on many cerebral diseases due to the difficulty in drug delivery across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In our project, we developed Bor-NP, a novel nanoparticle modified by borneol, which has been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs’ transport across the BBB. At the same time, we tried to establish a system which can mass-produce this kind of Bor-NP. We took advantage of Yarrowia lipolytica to boost the borneol production, and then conjugate these borneol to the succinimide group of N-hydroxy succinimide–poly(ethyleneglycol)–poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (NHS-PEG-PLGA) to produce the Bor-NP. In a conclusion, our project focused on producing nanoparticles to get through the BBB and establishing an effective bio-manufacturing system to produce this kind of nanoparticle to lower the cost and achieve better therapeutic effect.

Current biosecurity and prevention strategies (e.g. intravenous vaccination) are insufficient and logistical nightmares, resulting in deaths of millions of poultry worldwide. With Nanobuddy we propose a novel solution by engineering Lactobacillus reuteri, a native species in the lung and intestinal microbiome of chickens, to secrete broadly neutralizing nanobodies against bird flu. These nanobodies bind to a conserved region of the virus’s hemagglutinin receptor, blocking it from entering cells. We researched several facets of our project: We investigated L. reuteri’s ability to secrete nanobodies and explored via lung-microbiomics L. reuteri’s presence in Dutch chickens. We explored the efficacy of the anti-avian influenza nanobodies and proposed an in-silico nanobody design workflow. Additionally, we developed a temperature sensitive biosafety module and performed extensive human practice to inform our final product. Nanobuddy, administered as a convenient spray, might revolutionize the fight against avian influenza.

Duke iGEM is developing NODES, a high-throughput organoid-based drug screening platform to characterize treatment efficacy in the common IDH1/2-mutant glioma variant. Our platform measures cellular levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an oncometabolite associated with pathway dysregulation, therapeutic resistance, and cancer progression. After identifying a D-2HG biosensor in Phase 1, we constructed a fluorescence-based reporter system in Phase 2. We validated the system’s operational characteristics, including input-output dose response and D-2HG measurement accuracy. To explore the socioethical implications of our work, we extended our Phase 1 stakeholder analyses to review how sexual and racial representation in sample cell lines impact research. Through its physiologically relevant and dynamically measurable design, NODES has the potential to accurately characterize drug responses, offering new hope to glioma patients.

Currently no sufficient treatment exists, especially in China, due to lack of effective and affordable drugs. This year, team iBowu-China learned about a plant-based substance, Astragalin, with the potential to be an effective cure. Astragalin is a natural flavonoid compound existing in medicinal plants. The traditional extraction doesn't lead to high enough product quantity and limited its large scale usage with economical availability. We study the bio-synthesis pathway of manufacturing Astragalin using engineered E. coli, expressing a series of plant-originated enzymes in the strains to generate Astragalin from a widely available substrate Naringenin. Experimentally we characterized the production of the enzymes, verified the production of Astragalin and attempted to optimize the production conditions for higher yields.

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have shown us much potential for solving global issues. Yet, the release of GMOs in the natural environment has been a huge safety concern, inhibiting the implementation into the wider society. Also, to encourage innovation, It is crucial to protect the intellectual property, in particular the gene sequence of GMOs, and GMOs themselves, from malicious interest and dual-use. This year, we present OPTOPASS, an optogenetic passcode system for microorganisms. In this system, S.cerevisiae produces the target substances only when exposed to the correct color of light in the correct order. However, when the light is applied in the wrong order or the culture is left under the sunlight, a kill switch is activated. Using our unique approach combining “Light” and “Order”, OPTOPASS proposes greater safety and security for the future of synthetic biology.

4240	USTC-Software	MEI?Modified Enzyme Interface	Usually, a complete metabolic pathway contains multiple ‘nodes’ and multi-step reactions. Sometimes there is no readily suitable enzyme in the database for the catalysis of the reaction, which brings some difficulties to the study. Although some pathway design software, such as PathPred, can predict the entire metabolic pathway, it is still inevitable that intermediate reactions will be disconnected. Therefore, Modified Enzyme Interface (MEI) is designed to provide enzyme candidates to catalyze unknown reactions. With the premise of single step reaction, MEI screened out the potential enzymes by using a structure comparison algorithm. On this basis, users can select the enzyme for further modification, which is more likely to obtain efficient enzymes that can catalyze the target reaction. With MEI, we hope to help synthetic biologists shorten the experimental time and find the desired enzyme more quickly.

To validate efficacy, the isolated CecB is tested against common aquatic pathogens. The in-vitro cleavage system, barring the signal peptide, is also expressed using a bacterial chassis. This is to test the design and quantify the differences between microalgal and bacterial synthetic capabilities. To modify the system for industrial use, the signal peptide is removed and the SUMO-protease is additionally inserted, under a nitrogen-starvation inducible promoter, to cleave SUMO in-vivo and generate active AMPs.

However, it has not been possible to monitor c-di-GMP levels in real time in many bacteria, which limits to effectively screen c-di-GMP-targeted antipathogenic compounds. To overcome this limitation, we will construct a c-di-GMP biosensor that is readily adaptable for gauging c-di-GMP levels in different bacteria. To demonstrate the application of the c-di-GMP biosensor, we will use it as a tool to screen agents that can induce Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis biofilm dispersal by decreasing its c-di-GMP levels.

Currently employed screening methods, suffer from low detection rates and result in frequent false positives, leading to missed diagnoses or unnecessary follow-up treatments. We created Colourectal, an easy-to-use living diagnostic tool. We engineered the probiotic strain Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to bind to tumour cells, detect two distinct cancer biomarkers, and secrete a coloured protein in the stool. We modelled and constructed a threshold-based circuit that detects the lactate biomarker, resulting in expression of a signal protein at significantly elevated lactate levels. The second biomarker, matrix metalloproteinase 9, activates the colour of our signal protein. Additionally, we have implemented biosafety circuits to limit viability of E. coli Nissle 1917 to the colon, by creating a dependence on temperature and mucin, and introduced an inducible kill-switch. Finally, we have modelled the potential persistence of our living diagnostic in the gut.

4245	Lambert_GA	CADlock: Early Screening for Coronary Artery Disease by Detecting MicroRNAs Through the Rolling Circle Approach	Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for 17.8 million deaths worldwide annually, with especially high rates in the southeastern United States. Current detection methods are costly and invasive, making them inaccessible to many. CADlock utilizes microRNA biomarkers to provide a novel screening tool for CAD. Our project uses padlock probes with rolling circle amplification to quantify microRNAs via fluorescence. Furthermore, we developed ProbeBuilder, a padlock probe generating software based on microRNA input, and Micro-Q, a portable fluorescent quantifier that allows for point-of-care screening for CAD. Current microRNA research in CAD is limited, which led us to offer CADlock as a tool for researchers to add miRNA characterization. We contacted stakeholders, including the American Heart Association, Georgia Office of Cardiac Health, cardiologists, researchers, and patients to gain feedback on the impact of our project. CADlock provides an additional detection method for researchers and physicians, facilitating a point-of-care screening procedure for CAD.

4247	UCopenhagen	Netlantis: Making a sustainable impact in the fishing industry by developing novel net fibres	Fishing is one of the biggest industries in the world, yet it is not the most sustainable one. Fishing nets made of nylon take 600-800 years to fully degrade. Lost nets are estimated to constitute at least 46% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and they can injure or kill around 650.000 animals each year. Therefore, a more environmentally friendly approach is urgent and paramount to ensure the stability of the industry and the environment it affects. By using spider silk, which has strength and flexibility comparable to nylon, and combining it with mussel foot protein, we aim to create fibres that can be twinned into biodegradable fishing nets. We foresee that further work in the line of our research and innovation will not only make a great impact and contribution for the development of a sustainable fishing industry but also to meet the UN SDGs.

4248	Shanghai_city	Fish tank scavenger	This research aims to find an alternative solution to bacterial inhibition. Currently, antibiotics are popular choices due to their effectiveness against microorganism infection, while their abuse leads to bacterial resistance issues thus posing a huge threat to global health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are alkaline polypeptides that can inhibit bacterial activity without causing bacterial resistance. For this issue, we developed five types of AMPs based on the following functional genes: Hydramacin-1, Spheniscin-2, Sparamosin26-54, LL-37, and fusion. The target gene was integrated into plasmid pET28a(+), expressing AMPs in E.coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Besides the development of bacterial inhibition functions, the fusion AMP has antifungal abilities. Because the aquariums regularly replace a lot of water, we hope that the AMPs created can shed light on a more convenient method of fish tank cleaning to save water resources.

4249	HBUT-China	Antioxidant Alchemy: Cutting-edge synthesis of the potent antioxidant Ergothioneine	Aging and diseases are associated with the production of excess free radicals. Finding an effective way to scavenge free radicals is thought to be one of food and cosmetic industries. Ergothioneine (EGT), a natural antioxidant, which is commonly found in mushrooms, has fairly powerful properties. However, human body cannot synthesize it, as a result, there is a huge market demand for the production of Ergothioneine. Our main goal is to achieve higher production of EGT. We engineered s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a chassis for the production of EGT. We applied CRISPR-Cas9 technology to integrate two genes into the yeast genome, and succeeded in constructing EGT biosynthesis pathway in S.cerevisiae. Additionally, the production can be further improved after optimizing the media with proper concentration of amino acids, which is the precursor of EGT. This work offers a more sustainable, low cost and efficient approach for the industrial production of EGT.

Our project focuses on three native genetic parts related to phosphorus metabolism in E.coli genome. Pst complex, which generally express during phosphorus starvation, is used to absorb phosphate efficiently. Phosphate in cytoplasm of E.coli can polymerize to create poly-phosphate(polyP) as the storage form. This process is conducted by mutated PPK protein. YjbB complex, which generally conducts phosphate release, is regulated for phosphate recycling.The framework of these parts is conducted by a thermal-sensitive repressor called cI857. The genetic-modified E.coli strain can switch its mode between phosphate absorbing and release in different thermal condition.

4255	SHSBNU_China	SynFlora7	Eye protection problems have become the one of biggest worries for Chinese teenagers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are assumed to damage eye cell proteins. Sunlight and electronic screens emit blue light, that is assumed to penetrate the human lens to the eye macular area and lead to oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are natural pigments widely found in plants, mostly flowers. They are reported as healthcare products to assist many physiological functions, including eye protection and anti-oxidative effects. This year, SHSBNU-China aims to construct an intact metabolic pathway in E.coli, to give them the ability to produce anthocyanins. The whole pathway to producing anthocyanins contains seven enzymes. We used molecular biology and synthetic biology methods to express enzymes in E.coli and verified the production of anthocyanin. We attempted to characterize the enzyme production quality under different experiment conditions to optimize the yield and proposed products using anthocyanins to protect students' eyes.

4257	CPU_Nanjing	Accelerating the Evolution of Phosphorus on Terrestrial Planets by Coupling Phosphite Oxidation and Polyphosphate Synthesis.	Low oxidation state phosphite, the dominant form of phosphorus on terrestrial planets, posed a formidable challenge on future interstellar migration. Involved in every aspect of life, phosphate rather phosphite is indispensable in the progress of human civilization. Thus, manufacture phosphate form phosphite is key to future success. Herein, by coupling phosphite dehydrogenase (PD) and polyphosphate kinase (PPK), we proposed a strategy that can spur E. coli to continuously produce phosphate from phosphite. In our engineered metabolic pathway, polyphosphate that derived from intracellular ATP is the crucial intermediate. Given that one phosphoric acid radical of ATP is deprived by PPK for polyphosphate synthesis, regeneration of ATP necessitated the oxidation of more phosphite by PD, thus achieving a high phosphate yield. In addition, to achieve the production trial in the context of terrestrial planets, we developed solar-energy driven algae processing hardware aiming at providing oxygen and nutrients for the engineered chassis.

4258	NDSU	A Better Alternative to Azo Dyes	Our student-led iGEM team is working to develop natural dyes for textiles using engineered proteins produced in bacteria. Currently most textile dyeing relies on the use of azo dyes. These dyes can be carcinogenic, photosynthesis reducing agents, and contain heavy metals. They are also highly stable which makes them long lasting in an aquatic ecosystem. We want to replace this with a non-toxic, protein based dye that will denature in an aquatic environment. Many bacteria already produce natural pigments in a wide variety of colors that could be used in the dyeing process. We combined a naturally occurring pigment with a cellulose binding domain to allow for increased pigment retention in cotton fabrics. This process included creating multiple constructs to find optimal protein orientation. Our product will be able to replace the harmful synthetic dyes by offering a sustainable, environmentally safe alternative.

A novel and promising treatment for these cancers is called photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT utilizes nanoparticles that convert light at 800 nm from a laser to heat, which kills the tumor cells. Biological production of nanoparticles for PTT is superior to other synthesis methods. Our team developed a microbial factory to produce these nanoparticles by overexpressing the genes napA, copA, cueO, and melA in Escherichia coli BL21. These strains’ supernatants were used to reduce silver and gold ions and form bimetallic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were analyzed using spectrophotometry and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We employed a statistical model called Box-Behnken Design to optimize absorbance at 800 nm. The produced nanoparticles had an urchin-like shape and diameter of 50-100 nm, which is ideal for PTT, and were able to convert 800 nm light from a laser into heat.

The disease persists despite 40 years of available treatments because current methods are reactionary, inaccessible to affected communities, and slowly becoming ineffective. SchistoGONE introduces a novel, environmental approach to permanently ending schistosomiasis by exploiting the sporocyst stage of schistosoma residing in biomphalaria glabrata. SchistsoGONE starts with the biosynthesis of plant-based, anti-schistosomal compound sanguinarine using a 7 plasmid e.coli and W303 s.cerevisiae combination—an optimized biosynthesis pathway and insurance that environmental containment breach releases only benign substrates. Modified microorganisms are contained in specially designed plates situated by bodies of water that allow easy access for biomphalaria glabrata snails, naturally attracted to yeast. The resultant consumption of sanguinarine by the sole intermediary host of schistosoma eradicates residing sporocysts. SchistoGONE can save the lives of nearly a billion and improve countless more by eradicating schistosomiasis at its source.

Detection of this chemical requires liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which is not easily accessible due to the high cost and extensive training needed. Therefore, efforts to develop a more accessible detection method are crucial. The UChicago iGEM 2022 team has begun developing a bacterial biosensor using a T7 polymerase to amplify a fluorescent signal upon PFOA detection. A promoter found in bacterial species Rhodococcus jostii, known as prmA, responds to the presence of PFOA in the environment. Previous work by USAFA iGEM 2019 showed that driving red fluorescent protein expression using only prmA yielded low RFP expression. Therefore, our designed system uses prmA to drive expression of a T7 polymerase. By placing a T7 promoter upstream of a green fluorescent protein gene, our design aims to amplify GFP to visible levels, allowing for easy, inexpensive water testing in the field.

4270	GDSYZX	Application of photoinducible promoter in the biosynthesis of patchoulol in yeast	Patchoulol is one of the main active components of Pogostemon cablin, which is often used to defend against phytopathogenic microbes and combat human diseases. Patchoulol can be obtained by natural extraction, chemical synthesis, and synthetic biology engineering. However, the natural extraction is often low-efficiency, and the chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure patchoulol. We engineered high level patchoulol production in yeast by overexpression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase(FPS, ERG20) and patchoulol synthase (PTS) either driven by strong promoter or light-induced promoter HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE173 (HCF173). The strategy increased the synthesis of patchoulol, which may also provide the foundations to generat higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications.

4271	Wego_Taipei	Eutro in Vitro: Synthetic Biological Reduction of Phosphate Concentration to Resolve Eutrophication	In various water bodies, the overabundance of nutrients from agricultural chemicals, including fertilizers and biocides, resulted in the process of eutrophication. The increase of phosphate and nitrogen amounts leads to algal bloom followed by the decline in sustainability of lives in the water bodies. The physical and chemical solutions that currently exist are limited to certain conditions and could potentially disturb the ecosystem. Our project presents a new method to solve the issue of eutrophication from its roots. By engineering bacteria that overexpress organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) and antisense PhoU mRNA (AsPhoU), we can hydrolyze organic phosphates into inorganic phosphate (Pi) for detoxification, enhance the efficacy of Pi transport, and fix the excess of Pi into polyphosphate (polyP), respectively. The implementation of a filtering device containing the engineered bacteria with biosensors for the detection of polyphosphate accumulation could reduce phosphate levels in water bodies to ultimately prevent the cycle of eutrophication.

4273	LINKS_China	UV-PRISMA: UltraViolet radiation Protection and skin Repairing by Innovative Sunscreen with Mycosporine-like Amino acids	UV-radiation damages our skin, causing sunburn, inflammation and skin aging. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are natural products produced by various marine organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae, able to absorb UV radiation. However, the low rate of MAA production limits the potential of commercializing MAAs as sunscreen ingredient. This year, LINKS_China engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce three MAAs—shinorine, porphyra-334 and palythine—and another UV-absorbing molecule, gadusol. We incorporated enzymes from Nostoc punctiforme, Nostoc linckia and Actinosynnema mirum to structure the optimal pathway, and introduced the xylose metabolism pathway to increase yield. These yeast products has successfully absorbed UV radiation, covering most UVA and UVB rays. For skin repairing, we introduced superoxide dismutase and catalase to remove reactive oxidative species produced in the skin. UV-PRISMA, our MAA-based sunscreen product, will bring a healthier, gentler, and more environmentally friendly way of UV protection.

Inspired by cellulosome from C.thermocellum, we designed two cellulosome-like protein complexes to degrade the cellulose and PET respectively. Accordingly, we engineered Kluyveromyces. marxianus to express dockerin-fused cellulase, “cellulase boosters”, PETase and MHETase, which can be assembled on to mini scaffoldins expressed by E.coli. Moreover, we enable E.coli to express a surface display system and thereby as the host of our “cellulosome-like nanomachines”. Eventually, the products can be converted back into high-value textiles, including bacterial cellulose and polyester. GreatBay_SCIE further explored enzyme-microbe synergy to improve the efficiency of enzymes and metabolically inactivate microorganisms to boost the yield of products. Therefore, our nanomachines can serve as an innovative means of cloth recycling in the future.

It's estimated that ?2% of the population are affected by chronic wounds in the United States alone. We aim to produce wound-healing ""plasters"" with particularly high biocompatibility for poorly healing open wounds from synthetically produced spider threads. To accomplish this, we produce spidroins (spider silk proteins) with modified Escherichia coli. After protein purification, the threads would be spun to bundle them. The tissue would be applied directly to the previously cleaned and disinfected affected area. Promotion of wound healing in the inflammation, granulation and regeneration phases would be achieved by incorporating the moist wound environment through the patch as part of a synthetic skin."

4294	Athens	PERspectives: In-vitro development of PERceptrons	Inspired by computer science, our project's goal is to implement the perceptron, a computational algorithm that is the basis of Artificial Neural Networks, in a biological system. By imitating a single-layered perceptron, an input pattern is converted into an intermediate signal in a weighted manner. Then, using an activation function, it is classified to a specific class. Our system is built on a population scale to avoid the metabolic burden of a single-cell system by taking advantage of the natural ways bacteria communicate, i.e., exploiting bacterial quorum sensing signals, Acyl-Homoserine-Lactones, in E.Coli consortia. Ribosome Binding Site variants are used as plug-and-play devices to tune the weights, and a steep genetic activation function is built to engineer a living binary classifier. Along with other research, the proposed workflow aims to pave the way for taking biological information processing a step further, giving rise to the emergence of biological artificial intelligence.

Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a crop that is both severely affected by heat and vital for global nutrition; therefore, producing heat-tolerant wheat varieties would be an essential step toward global food security. Synaestivum aims to reach this objective through the heat-inducible expression of enzymes that offset metabolic stress under heat conditions, prevent protein misfolding, and increase yield through an optimized photosynthetic rate. As a proof of concept, we optimized the isolation of wheat protoplasts to validate the expression of this genetic system. As complementary efforts to validate our design and implementation, we built a hardware device that detects activation of our constructs for implementation in the field, and utilized bioinformatic analyses to confirm that the gene pathways in our design are significantly overexpressed in heat conditions."

4297	NJXDF-CHN	Bring us closer by fragrance -- Refactoring Yarrowia lipolytica to high produce 2-phenylethanol	2-phenylethanol (2-PE) is a fatty alcohol with the aroma of rose, which is considered as an essential flavoring ingredient in the food and cosmetic industry because of its mild and elegant smell. In nature, 2-PE is mainly extracted from rose, jasmine, tomato, and buckwheat plants. However, the concentration of 2-PE in plants is deficient and susceptible to natural factors, such as weather and plant diseases, resulting in the cost of extracting 2-PE up to 3500-6000 USD/kg. Cheap 2-PE can be prepared by chemical synthesis, but the process of producing benzene ethanol by chemical synthesis is complicated. Therefore, we constructed an engineered strain utilizing synthetic biology, so that it can synthesize natural, green, and sustainable 2-PE to meet the needs of the food and cosmetics industry. We hope our obtained 2-pE can be developed to trend-leading and unique 2-PE products according to different people and scenarios.

4298	Peking	DEEPI, a new paradigm of antibiotic resistance	Nowadays, antibiotic resistance is one of the top ten global public health threats. Among many solutions against this crisis, EPI (Efflux Pump Inhibiter) is a potentially efficient kind of medicine in response to drug resistance generated by efflux pumps, the most important mechanism of antibiotic resistance. However, most of current EPI have several disadvantages: Difficult to synthesize, Toxic and Low effect commendably, which hinders its further clinical application. Our project aimed to develop a standardized modular short-peptide EPI optimization procedure based on directed evolution and Yeast-E.coli co-culture system. Through this procedure, as long as we know the structure of an efflux pump, we could generate an efficient EPI that could been synthesized by microorganisms easily. For security reasons?we used AcrB pump in E.coli as a demonstration of our project and successfully constructed the co-culture system this summer. We hope to come up with a new solution to the antibiotic crisis.

4299	Sesame_Shenzhen	Uric Acid Lowering Probiotic	Uric acid (C5H4N4O) is the end-product of purine catabolism. The increased consumption of foods such as red meat, seafood, and alcoholic beverages is directly associated with high uric acid blood levels and a higher prevalence of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia can lead to the formation of urate stones and gout and is an independent risk factor for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and mortality. Adverse side effects and disadvantages have been identified for existing treatment methods, which confirm the need for a much safer uric acid-lowering treatment therapy with no adverse side effects. Our project introduces exogenous uricase as a novel treatment method. We utilized molecular cloning technologies to insert the gene encoding for urate oxidase into Escherichia Coli, uricase oxidase can decompose uric acid. Our method is associated with various long-term, sustainable benefits, and does not correlate with any adverse side effects.

It causes hopelessness, or even suicidal thoughts. To help relieve depression, our team developed a probiotic to regulate depression, based on the gut-brain axis. Since it has been previously proven that 5-HTP can increase the concentration of serotine in the brain to improve mood, and GABA can block certain nerve cells to inhibit anxiety and stress, we overexpressed the TPH1 gene into E.coli Nissle 1917(EcN) to catalyze the production of tryptophan which consequently catalyzes the biopterin-dependent monooxygenation of tryptophan to 5-HTP. Meanwhile, we overexpressed the GadB gene in EcN to convert the glutamate to GABA using pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor. To prevent genetically modified contamination, our team developed a suicide system for the strain. This probiotic has the potential to establish a more peaceful society with higher productivity.

Considering the limitations of current mediums, an alternative method for data storage has been proposed: storing data in DNA which is more cost and space efficient. Binary data is encoded into nucleotide bases. However, DNA, when exposed to stress factors deforms, leading to lost or altered data in DNA; thus, methods to ensure the stability of DNA are critical to implementing DNA data storage. We hypothesized that forming Transcription Factor A Mitochondria (TFAM)-DNA complex in an aqueous solution supports DNA stability during data storage and retrieval. TFAM preserves DNA inside the mitochondria, acting as an adequate stabilizer. The TFAM-DNA complex was created with replicated human lung cDNA and purified TFAM protein. This complex was able to maintain stability in conditions with various stress factors, suggesting that DNA can be a viable method to store data."

4309	NPU-CHINA	Ligninolytic enzymes: a PAHs killer	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of semi-volatile organic compound that is abundant in the environment. Ligninolytic enzymes such as laccases and lignin peroxidases are potential biological pathways for bioremediation of PAHs. However, there are few studies on the heterologous expression of ligninolytic enzymes in Escherichia coli to degrade PAHs. The present study investigated the oxidation of PAHs using laccase CotA from Bacillus subtilis and lignin peroxidase LipH8 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. It was observed that recombinant CotA and LipH8 had significant oxidation effects on PAHs. Moreover, combined ligninolytic enzymes are a better candidate for the remediation of PAHs than a single ligninolytic enzyme. An arabinose-regulated suicide switch was built to induce suicide once the engineered bacteria were released from the environment for biosafety. Our work will allow the design of biocatalysts for ligninolytic enzyme engineering and provide new insight into the remediation of PAHs by combined ligninolytic enzymes.

However, traditional biodegradable oil absorbents are hardly ideal due to their low cost-efficiency and poor oil adsorption capacity. One promising alternative material is brown rot fungi-decomposed pine trees, which has extremely high hydrophobicity and oleophilicity due to its high lignin content. However, the decomposition process takes up to 10 years in nature, making the mass production of the material impractical. To tackle this problem, we used E. Coli and Bacillus Subtilis to mass produce 4 types of cellulose-degrading enzymes. Treating pine tree powder with these genetically modified organisms secreting enzymes of interest resulted in an increase of lignin content from 25~30% to 39~47% while also showing significant improvement in oil adsorption. Our novel approach speeded up the decomposition process to 12 weeks, providing the potential for mass production of promising alternative oil absorbent material.

In Ontario, Leamington alone is home to more greenhouse acreage than the entire United States. However, many factors influence yield of these crops, and growers can experience massive yield losses due to insect damage. To meet the demand for innovative strategies to control insect pests, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to inducibly express insect Cytotoxic (Cyt) proteins through an IPTG responsive promoter, Pgrac. When “off”, the modified B. subtilis behaves normally and may have a positive effect on plant growth. When “on,” the bacterial biofilm produces Cyt proteins, creating a pesticide barrier to any Dipteran insect larvae that may be present in the soil. This powerful bioinsecticide designed by iGEM Guelph will place a new tool in the hands of growers to combat harmful greenhouse insect pathogens.

4323	UManitoba	ZebraZap: A Smart Bio-Based Device for Controlling Invasive Zebra Mussels	This year the Prairie iGEM team, hosted here at the University of Manitoba, aims to develop a novel solution to control the invasive populations of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). The invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) pose threats to many water bodies in North America and create a burden for local communities. Zebra mussels can clog up a pipeline supplying water to communities, damage infrastructure, and disrupt ecosystems. We aim to build a proof-of-concept for a smart bio-based device that can lay dormant and express molluscicide to specifically target zebra mussels. Our project is comprised of two parts. Firstly, we explored the iGEM registry for methods to sense zebra. Secondly, we optimize the expression and secretion of certain molluscicides in our model chassis. Finally, we combined the two parts to get a final bio-based device that can express and secrete molluscicide only in the presence of zebra mussels.

4324	TheKingsSchool_AU_HS	Sweet Genes: E. coli with Improved Xylose Utilisation	A large amount of bio-waste is burnt or deposited in landfill, releasing harmful greenhouse gases. Much of agricultural bio-waste contains plant dry matter, or lignocellulose, approximately half of which is glucose and 18-30% is xylose. Synthetic biologists can engineer E. coli to grow on lignocellulosic biomass and produce clean bio-energy. However, carbon catabolite repression and diauxic growth controls the order in which different carbon sources are metabolised, and so E. coli preferentially utilises glucose over xylose, meaning xylose content in lignocellulose is not utilised to its full potential. We have increased the xylose uptake of E. coli by inducing a yeast-derived XR-XDH pathway in E. coli to provide an alternative route for catabolising xylose to xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P). We also induced phosphoketolase to alleviate the flux of X5P through glycolysis. We envision our improved E. coli strain to serve as a chassis organism that optimises the efficiency of sustainable bio-energy production.

To improve the production of acarbose, our project intends to develop a generalized modeling software, by adding constraints to the genome-wide metabolic model of actinomycetes and combining deep learning to predict model parameters, it provides a feasible solution for the reconstruction of Deep Learning-based Enzyme-Constrained Genome-scale Metabolic model (DL-ecGEM) for actinomycetes. The model can also be used for simulation experiments. Through that, some hotspot identification tools can be used to find directional transformation plans for cells. Combined with the transformation recommendations given by the software, the deep learning network will be updated and can re-predict the parameters in the model. Thus, the phenotypic changes in acarbose production can be observed through simulation. At the same time, the model parameters can be optimized based on experimental data to make the model more accurate.

4329	BS_United_China	S. aureus Bacterial Inhibition with TurboID	Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) threats the food safety especially for home storage. The enterotoxins can be generated by S. aureus quorum sensing (QS) system related to several genes named accessory gene regulator (Agr). Only AgrC and AgrB encode channel proteins which can react with autoinducing peptide (AIP). To block the QS channels, we utilized protein proximity labeling technology by fusing TurboID with N-AgrD and AIP. The fused proteins will bring TurboID to the quorum sensing channels AGRC and AGRB which will further be blocked by protein biotinylation on multiple lysine residues. The automatic biotinylation happens when the engineered Escherichia coli itself can produce more biotin through its own metabolic pathways. We therefore increased the expression of dethiobiotin synthetase and biotin synthase and, at the same time, knock-out of biotin consumption gene named bifunctional ligase/repressor BirA by CRISPR-Cas9. Thus, purified TurboID-AIP can be used for protecting food and our health.

We believe that Chitosan oligosaccharide can do something valuable. After reading some articles, we decided to investigate the topic about converting into chitosan oligosaccharide since chitosan is insoluble in water, but chitosan oligosaccharide is soluble in water, and it maintain the value that chitosan brings. Shells will be converted into chitosan oligosaccharide. Our experiment will mainly focus on the last part of the progress. We use cell surface display to make our experiment result better. The work which changes chitosan to chitosan oligosaccharide works more efficient when it takes place on the cells surface. Chitosan oligosaccharide has a lot of values which is good for either human or animals and even plants. It can antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, make animal bones stronger and help the growth of roots.	High School				2022	Xiangkai Li		Tuoyu Zhou	Yang Yiwei, Zhang Zongyue, ???

4331	LZU-HS-China-B	Recombinant probiotics reduce alcohol-induced damage in humans	In our society, there is a group of people who work in the alcohol industry and have to drink alcohol every day because of their work. The excessive consumption of alcohol can cause damage to health, and coupled with the fact that companies do not provide them with certain safety measures, the health of these people is not guaranteed. Escherichia Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been widely demonstrated to be a safe oral probiotic. In this study, we genetically modified EcN expressing the ethanol dehydrogenase gene, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, NAD synthase gene, and NADH oxidase gene. By expressing the NAD synthase and NADH oxidase genes, the efficiency of ethanol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was increased, and thus the rate of alcohol decomposition was increased. Finally, we constructed an intestinal probiotic with high efficiency in alcohol catabolism to help alcoholic beverage workers to protect their health.

4334	ASIJ_Tokyo	Project LOTUS: Don't FRET	In recent years, breast cancer has seen a surge in cases globally and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Current screening methods, including mammograms and MRIs, can be uncomfortable and costly, discouraging many women from regular screening. However, early detection can greatly increase survival rates, calling for the need for a better screening method. We thus propose a convenient and minimally-invasive testing kit for breast cancer. Our initial research revealed that Mucin 1 is overexpressed in patients, so we initially planned to detect its concentrations through a lateral flow assay (LFA). However, we switched to Aptamer FRET this year upon learning that LFAs are less accurate than expected. Due to a higher range of error than expected and a risk of false positives, we concluded that this method is best used to detect other diseases where any concentration of biomarker indicates that a patient requires treatment.

Currently, based on clinical manifestations, the regular treatment is antibiotics like Bactroban Nasal. Consequently, it is necessary to find a way to diagnose and treat them quickly and effectively. The aim of project is to create a multi-functional dressing using the microneedle system (MN) and synthetic peptides composed by antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to achieve rapid and effective detection and sterilization of S. aureus. Additionally, AMP can reduce the possibility of multi-drug resistance. For specificity, linker cleaved by V8 protease turn the antimicrobial peptide complex (AMPC) into AMPs. The MN is made of hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA) and gelatin as the specific triggered coating and drug carrier, respectively. Herein, We developed a simple, rapid, and biosafe dressing prevent killing other bacteria on the skin and releases the drug once encountering S. aureus.

Surprisingly, only 5% of Peruvian cacao exporters actually meet these requirements, for which almost 50,000 cacao farmers are reporting income loss. In collaboration with Alianza Cacao, our team is developing a cadmium detection system to provide on-site detection of areas with high amounts of cadmium in the soil. We are also working on developing a plasmid construct with a MerR protein that blocks the promoter region of the RFP gene. This MerR protein can be inhibited in the presence of cadmium, allowing the amount of cadmium in the soil to be relatively determined by the amount of RFP protein produced. Once high levels of cadmium are detected in the soil, the next step will be using hyperaccumulating plants along with modified rhizobacteria to bioremediate cadmium in the soil.

4340	PuiChing_Macau	Supporting hydroponic farming using engineered bacteria? hormone-targeting and pH-adjusting systems	Due to the increasing food shortage caused by global warming, populated cities, including Macau, need alternative sustainable food sources to stabilize the supply. While hydroponics can be used to increase food supply, the yield of such a system is relatively low. One of the reasons is that the nutrition solution needs to be discarded regularly, to prevent pH changes. Here, we engineered E. coli to include a genetic pH Shooting (GPS) system which can neutralize the solution from time to time. To further increase the yield, we also created the hormone binding systems (HBDs), as some plant hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) are known to slow down plant growth. We here engineered E. coli to produce hormone binding proteins, T2R4 and PYL8, to inhibit ABA. By using HBD and GPS, we hope to establish a sustainable hydroponic agriculture system in the near future.

This extreme immune response is termed as sepsis and is associated with 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Our solution is to use an engineered phage therapy that directly targets the infectant, after detection with a phage reporter assay. Phages are advantageous because they are bacteria specific, a phage can be used to target a specific bacteria. Once a blood sample is obtained, our library of engineered phage will carry a fluorescent gene that will result in fluorescent bacteria once the phage inserts in its DNA. Phage types that lead to fluorescence will be administered to the patient in the phage therapy step. Additionally, interactive exhibits were held at local museums to engage the community on synthetic biology and how it could be used to address sepsis.	Diagnostics	Gold Medal			2022	Scott A.

For our project, we developed a detection system capable of recognizing any eDNA featuring ADP1 as a chassis. ARROWE specifically focuses on detecting eDNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a fungus that causes White Nose Syndrome in bats. This system works via homologous recombination, which occurs when P. destructans eDNA is detected, producing a fluorescent signal and yielding resistance to azidothymidine. We also constructed and tested ADP1 strains engineered to detect the nptII and blaTEM-1 antibiotic resistance genes to demonstrate other applications of our approach and characterize parameters affecting DNA detection. We hope ARROWE will draw attention to ADP1’s potential and serve as a model for future ADP1-centric projects.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are essential omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have irreplaceable effects on human health. Therefore, if eggs are rich in DHA and EPA, they can be incorporated into the daily diet of humans. Currently, only DHA eggs are available on the market, and it is obtained by feeding flaxseed into the feed of laying hens, which has the disadvantage of low content and high cost.

Our team has designed a therapeutic platform where siRNA against a specific viral encephalitis can be produced easily in E.coli and packed into the corresponding optimal formulation of liposomes. This optimal formulation is obtained with our microfluidics liposome generator in the future. Therefore, not only can we circumvent the blood brain barrier and transport therapeutics more effectively to the brain, but we also have created a platform technology to develop therapeutics against many different types of viral encephalitis.

Biosensors have been developed before but the tunability is mostly low, despite being fundamental for a broad application. The safety of biosensors also remains a hurdle to entering the clinics. Therefore, our goal is to develop a dose-dependent biosensor using NarX-NarL two-component nitrate sensing system and a naringenin responsive promotor in E. coli as a proof-of-concept. Temperature-sensitive riboswitches and a type II toxin-antitoxin system are used to establish biocontainment. To support and guide biosensor development, modeling is done to predict the threshold needed.

Currently, there are limited approaches to preventing CVD caused by high cholesterol. To address this, we designed and validated a novel three-step metabolic pathway to metabolize cholesterol into coprostanol, a sterol that cannot be absorbed in the gut. We subsequently integrated this pathway in B. subtilis, to engineer a cholesterol-lowering probiotic able to prevent intestinal cholesterol absorption. The pathway consists of ismA, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from the bacterium, E. coprostanoligenes, and two repurposed sterol-metabolizing enzymes from humans.

4349	UFMG_UFV_Brazil	ProChi - a new biodrug to treat helminth infections	Intestinal parasites are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. According to the World Health Organization, the world has about 1,5 billion infected people. These neglected diseases severely affect children and adolescents from vulnerable social groups in Brazil. The current strategy to control infections is administering anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, especially school-age children. Although this recommendation efficiently reduces cases, it can lead to increased resistance of parasites to current therapeutic options. Additionally, the diseases leave behind intestinal damage that can intensify malnutrition scenarios. So, we propose a new treatment: ProChi, which consists of genetically engineered Lactobacillus acidophilus that produces and secretes chitinase, an enzyme that cleaves chitin - a polysaccharide in the cuticles and eggs of nematodes. Therefore, it can kill these parasites and promote a quicker reconstitution of the intestinal tissue, contributing to the re-establishment of the nutritional absorption compromised by the disease.

4350	UBC-Okanagan	Life Bulb: An Autobioluminescent Lighting System in Cyanobacteria using Fungal Genes	Autobioluminescent organisms are the future of lighting. Electrical light contributes to 20% of energy consumption and 6% of global CO2 emissions, which are projected to increase 60% by 2030. Thus, we propose an autobioluminescent lighting system to tackle the climate crisis by reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We will engineer the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with a cyclical bioluminescent pathway elucidated from fungi, which has previously only been expressed in eukaryotes. Our genetic circuit was designed based on the analysis of genomic differences and field observations of different species of luminous fungi. With these fungal genes we will create a scalable, versatile, and carbon-negative lighting source. We engineered E. Coli with a codon optimized version of this pathway as a stepping-stone for expression and characterization of the system in Synechocystis. This proof-of-concept study will open the doors for an adaptable and efficient way of growing light.

4351	Lethbridge_HS	Dia-Beatable: Self-amplifying RNA as a medium for treatment of diabetes	Diabetes affects millions of people across the globe. Current treatments for Type I diabetes are routine insulin injections or islet cell transplants. Our proposed project, Dia-Beatable, utilizes self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) to produce insulin. The self-replicating nature will allow for fewer injections over longer periods of time. The proposed RNA construct would be self-regulating as we have incorporated an insulin-binding RNA aptamer as a control mechanism. This creates a negative feedback loop where the RNA aptamer acts a switch that terminates the translation process when insulin levels are high. Dia-Beatable also has potential uses in veterinary care and could be used to treat diabetes in pets as well. We hope that with our proposed treatment, patients and caregivers can minimize the strenuous maintenance process required when dealing with Type I diabetes.

In our project, a genetically engineered E. coli, the AcidOceanus, is planned to be constructed and applied to absorb H+ in the water body. Integrating the Xenorhodopsin gene, AcidOceanus produce Xenorhodopsin and constantly transport H+ from water into intracellular space under light conditions. Furthermore, as an approach to recycle H+, we are about to coordinate will some companies to design a device where E. coli release the H+ in dark condition.

When it becomes severe, ordinary wounds can lead to amputations. This year, NCHU_Taichung aims to develop a wound repair-promoting dressing for DM patients with an intrinsic compound, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). To increase the yield of PQQ, a well-known probiotic was used, <i> Bacillus subtilis </i> natto, as our host and redesigned the PQQ plasmid shown in 2021 NCHU_Taichung. A xylose-dependent promoter was implemented to regulate the biosynthesis rate. The fermentation product using glucose-induced keratinocyte to evaluate the effect of PQQ. The results of wound healing assay in HaCaT cells indicated when supplement with PQQ can accelerate the cell migration within 24 hours observation compare with untreated group, which provide a concrete evidence to increase DM patients’ injury recovery and has its high-potential to become a commercial product in a low-cost.

4359	IISER_TVM	Duonco: A dual nanovesicle drug delivery system targeting breast cancer	Poor specificity is a fundamental issue with contemporary cancer drug therapy, necessitating improved alternatives. We have conceptualized and developed Duonco, a dual nanovesicle drug delivery system to address breast cancer, a growing concern in our community. Duonco targets HER2 and CX3CR1, two cell surface markers over-expressed in HER2+ breast cancer. We bioengineered E. coli to produce two distinct outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) populations, to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic prodrugs and their cognate enzymes, respectively, into tumour cells. This system is developed such that it functions analogous to an AND gate, where the drug is only activated in cells that overexpress both markers, and remains inactivated or undelivered in normal cells. Using hypervesiculating strains of E. coli, we have generated OMVs expressing anti-HER2 or anti-CX3CR1 affinity proteins on their surface and characterized them. We propose that such an adaptable system has immense potential for cell-specific targeting as well as in personalized medicine.

With such a device, it will be possible to detect GHB in a spiked drink and alert users to prevent them from drinking it. We have designed a new kind of sensor for the detection of GHB in drinks by combining the specificity of biomolecules with the reliability of electronics. The sensor is integrated in a cup you can drink from, with a compartment in the bottom that holds the electrode and the electronic hardware. Our research involved the assembly of a working prototype from existing parts, as well as engineering new parts to improve the sensor.

This finding is supported by reports from Patancheru (India) that indicate levels of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin a million times higher than usually found in treated urban sewage. In Europe, sediments from the Sava river reveal antibiotic levels 1,000 times higher than normally expected. The first step of our project is to potentially find an enzyme that degrades multiple kinds of antibiotics found in water sources. To do this we talked with field professionals as well as did our own research, in order to find applicable antibiotics which could become water pollutants, leading to high levels of antibiotic resistance. After selecting the best enzymes for our purpose, our second step will be expressing them in laboratory Escherichia coli cells, in order to modify them via directed evolution for optimal activity in wastewater environments.

4365	TU_Dresden	WunderBand: a Bioresponsive Hydrogel Platform for Phage and Yeast-derived Growth Factor Therapy of Chronic Wounds	Chronic wounds are wounds that cannot progress through the normal stages of healing. They represent a growing problem, especially amongst aging populations and affect millions of patients each year. Chronic wounds are susceptible to bacterial infections and treatment relies heavily on antibiotics. Because of this, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains are on the rise, increasing patient morbidity and mortality. To combat resistant bacteria-infections, we have adopted phage therapy. Our team has developed a bioresponsive hydrogel wound dressing for the treatment of chronic wounds. The bioresponsive hydrogel releases bacteriophages upon stimulation of the gel by proteases produced by the infected wound. Moreover, we have created new genetic parts and screened signal peptides to transform yeast into an efficient biofactory for the secretion of human growth factors. Using the same principles as in our bioresponsive phage-hydrogel, the secreted growth factors are released and can help chronic wounds to overcome inflammation and aid in healing.

The current methods of treatment and diagnostics are insufficient. Therefore we wanted to develop a point of care test for DNA detection, enabling fast diagnosis and more accurate treatment of infected individuals. We have designed two separate systems. The first one is a cell free system that uses a fusion of dCas9 and split TEV protease. When bound to the target sequence it activates and induces alpha-complementation that forms the tetramer beta-galactosidase, which produces a blue pigment for a visual readout. The second method uses DNA-binding zinc fingers bound to the membrane of a yeast cell. Upon binding to the target sequence, production of the purple pigment violacein is induced as well as production of mating factor alpha. This induces the same genes in nearby cells, thereby amplifying the visible readout.

One example is glyphosate which has several sublethal effects on honey bees including weakening the immune system and a decrease in brood survival. For Beecilli, we designed a probiotic that heterogeneously expresses glyphosate-degrading enzymes. These proteins act on the C-P or C-N bonds of glyphosate breaking it down. By incorporating the foreign DNA into the chromosomal DNA, we provide a stable construct that does not require a constant selection pressure and thus simplifies potential real-life applications.

4377	NYCU_Formosa	Ubenefactrix	Protein-based materials are currently leading to promising applications in various fields. With the advent of biotechnology, diverse assembly approaches have been developed to further acquire biomaterials with desired functionalities. Self- assembled protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) from Drosophila melanogaster has been investigated as building blocks to construct material attributing to its inherent biocompatibility and mechanical properties. However, current yielding of Ubx has not achieved satisfactory results due to stress response. The aim of our work was to develop a novel biomaterial by engineering the Ubx functional domain. We first identified Y167 and Y240 domains, dityrosine containing motifs contributing to the linkings forming self-assembly, and engineered them with mRFP afterwards to test its functions. It is concluded that Ubx has the potential to successfully incorporate diverse functional proteins for wide applications in various fields.

4378	Uppsala	PETerminator: Enzymatic upcycling of polyethylenterephthalate (PET) into higher value chemicals	Plastic is a very useful material. However, plastic pollution has world-wide effects on our environment. At the same time, only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled. We need to develop better techniques for recycling and upcycling plastic in order to reverse the effects that plastic pollution has caused our environment. Therefore we decided to focus on degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics since it is one of the most abundant types of plastic, has the largest number of characterized enzymes (40) that can act on it, and its degradation is arguably the best studied of all the synthetic polymers. Our overarching goal was to build upon previous work surrounding plastic degradation, membrane transport and bacterial upcycling to develop an E. coli strain whole cell catalyst system with a fully integrated metabolic pathway that could degrade PET plastics and further turn them into the chemical protocatechuic acid (PCA).

4380	Vilnius-Lithuania	NanoFind: a novel way to detect nanoplastics in water samples	The NanoFind project aims to combat challenges regarding detection of newly recognised environmental pollutants - nanoplastics - the smallest fraction of plastic waste. Nanoplastics have already been found in water-based beverages and aquatic organisms. Current attempts to investigate nanoplastics rely on expensive optical equipment which is hardly applicable to the frequent monitoring of the abundance of plastic nanoparticles in the environment. The promising work of Rübsam and the colleagues (2017) inspired our project to focus on the binding affinities between specific peptides and plastic materials. To facilitate detection, we engineered two types of plastic-binding peptides that can either bind cellulose or produce a fluorescent signal as an easy-to-interpret result. Together, these molecules create a complex that captures and recognizes nanoplastic particles. This system enables lowering the cost of the detection process while maintaining high accuracy results. Therefore, efficient and frequent monitoring can be achieved in a more convenient way.

4382	IISER_Bhopal	Decomposition of crop residue using genetically engineered bacteria and its conversion into bioplastic	Crop residue left in agricultural fields after harvest is known as stubble. Farmers need to get rid of the stubble left in the field before they can sow again. One of the most common methods used by farmers in India to get rid of stubble is by burning them. Stubble-burning causes a lot of problems, including air pollution, respiratory health issues, loss of biodiversity, and depletion of soil fertility. Burning the lignocellulosic biomass also results in the loss of a potential renewable resource that can be converted into various beneficial products. Here we have genetically engineered bacteria that can synthesize and exude enzymes which decompose lignocellulosic biomass. Additionally, we have designed a method for extraction of vanillin from decomposed stubble, followed by its conversion into bioplastic. Our project fosters sustainable stubble management that can provide alternatives for two major environmental hazards: stubble burning and non-degradable plastic waste.

However, there are no reasonable solutions to several problems, such as colonization failure, low population density, and irregular expression of exogenous genes in vivo. Therefore, we designed an engineered probiotic platform based on the sugar substitute erythritol in order to solve the problems mentioned above. We introduce erythritol breaking down gene clusters and providing an exclusive metabolic niche in probiotics. When supplemented with erythritol stably in the diet, engineered probiotics will increase population density and colonization time in the intestinal microbiome. In addition, we precisely characterized the promoter of ery operon model, building an erythritol-induced regulatory system. Except for the platform, we introduced an erythritol utilization pathway downstream to synthesize small therapeutical molecules such as pyrroloquinoline quinone and L-erythrulose, giving this platform more therapeutical functions.

4384	HK_SSC	A biosynthetic production pathway of valerolactam using the cyanobacteria strain Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973.	The chemical commodity valerolactam is among a family of amides called lactams that are traditionally produced through petrochemical methods, which require intense energy and toxic environments. One of the end-products of valerolactam is nylon, which is heavily demanded every year. Taking note of the impact the petrochemical production methods of valerolactam has on the environment, we explore the biosynthesis of valerolactam as a green alternative. Switching to a biosynthetic production method of valerolactam allows an overall more sustainable manufacturing of its end-products. Molecular dynamic simulations are also carried out to improve the efficiency of existing enzymes. The precursor molecule to valerolactam, 5AVA, is synthesized by the cyanobacteria strain Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 using carbon dioxide as the carbon source. The cyclization enzyme 5YSS then cyclizes 5AVA to valerolactam, and the protein NitR embedded on magnetic beads captures valerolactam molecules. The NitR-valerolactam complex is then isolated by applying a magnetic field.

4386	DNHS_SanDiego_CA	OxyBANzone	Oxybenzone is a naturally-occurring organic compound and a component of many sunscreens providing broad spectrum ultraviolet light absorption. However, recent research has linked oxybenzone to coral bleaching, a growing problem in marine ecosystems, as well as DNA damage in corals and endocrine disruption in humans. Additionally, current research has focused mostly on the adverse effects of oxybenzone and not detection, which is important for future research to fully assess its impact. The goal of our project is to design a microbial in situ oxybenzone sensor that can rapidly indicate levels of oxybenzone. As oxybenzone is a xenoestrogen, our project uses an intracellular estrogen receptor, which binds to oxybenzone and uses it as a transcription factor to express GFP. The end product is a portable and efficient oxybenzone sensor that will play a vital role in future of oxybenzone research and protection of the ocean environment.

Current treatment options are systemic and aim at modulating the immune system causing severe side effects. We, the UZurich iGEM Team, want to tackle the lack of targeted treatment options by developing a new microbe based therapy: IBD NanoBiotics. We modified E. coli Nissle 1917 by introducing a genetic circuit that can produce and secrete anti tumor necrosis factor (TNF) nanobodies upon selective induction by nitric oxide (NO) at the inflammation site.

4388	KCL_UK	Engineering Escherichia coli to improve production of pterostilbene for patients with early stage Alzheimer’s disease	Over 55 million people worldwide are currently living with dementia, of which approximately 60-80% are Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. By 2050, this number will increase to nearly 155 million. The polyphenol pterostilbene is known to modulate one of the main hallmarks of AD by targeting the NLRP3/caspase-1 neuroinflammatory pathway. Currently, pterostilbene is purified from plants at concentrations too low for wide scale therapeutic use. Therefore, at Symemco Therapeutics we have engineered E. coli to improve the production of pterostilbene to be used in mild to moderate stage AD. By using four key enzymes involved in pterostilbene production: tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Rhodotorula glutinis, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana, stilbene synthase and resveratrol O-methyltransferase both from Vitis vinifera, we have created a system with the potential to produce pterostilbene at concentrations necessary for AD therapies. Thus, our improved pterostilbene production method has the capacity to help AD patients worldwide.

4390	Edinburgh-UHAS_Ghana	‘Petalution’ a Holistic Solution to PET Plastic and Heavy Metal Water Pollution	Water quality is of growing concern in Ghana with about 60% of the water bodies being polluted and most are in critical condition. The main cause of this pollution is unregulated industrial activities such as poor plastic waste management and illegal mining. From this issue, we identified PET plastic and heavy metals as tangible aspects of water pollution that could be mitigated. We wanted to develop a way to safely process PET pollution and heavy metals away from local communities. Through a literature search, we identified target proteins to mitigate Ghana’s water pollution issues – PET degrading PETases from Ideonella sakaiensis, and metal-binding metallothioneins from Mytilus edulis. From this, we created a cell-free biodegradation tool for PET pollution and a bioremediation device for sequestering heavy metals along with a cell-free biosensor to detect heavy metals (mercury, lead, cadmium and arsenic) to locate the acutely affected areas of heavy metal pollution.

The working of the chip was demonstrated in the detection of three microbes - bacteria E. coli, S. typhimurium, and fungus Penicillium. We have designed a platform that contains three specific aptamers against the three microorganisms. There is an electrical impedance change when aptamers bind to their respective targets. This impedance change (in the form of electrical current) is relayed to the neural chip that identifies the microbes (out of the three) present in the sample.

4392	IISER-Pune-India	Hydrazome—reducing waterlogging-based stress responses in plants through hypoxia-induced breakdown of ACC	12% of the world’s arable land is waterlogged frequently, leading to approximately 20% crop yield reduction. Global warming causes waterlogging to be even more unpredictable in its nature, making it troublesome to solve. Waterlogging is excessive accumulation of water in the plant rhizosphere, negatively affecting plant and soil health. In plants, waterlogged soil causes exaggerated stress responses, releasing harmful amounts of ethylene. Hydrazome is a biofertiliser containing an engineered nitrogen-fixing, plant growth-promoting soil bacterium. We will be introducing the acdS gene to break down ACC in the soil before it is taken up by the plant and converted to harmful ethylene. The acdS gene will be in effect only during waterlogging, when the hypoxic conditions of the soil activate our hypoxia-induced promoter. We will also be upregulating the production of exopolysaccharides to absorb water, nutrients, and promote soil aggregation. Hydrazome will aid crops throughout their life, with or without waterlogging.

4397	NYU_Abu_Dhabi	Development of an early diagnostic device for Alzheimer’s disease using surface functionalized aptamers	Alzheimer’s disease–a progressive neurological disorder that leads to brain atrophy and neuronal loss–is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. It affects about 6.5 million people aged 65 or older in the United States alone. The condition is also notoriously difficult to diagnose early, especially before onset of clinical symptoms such as memory loss and cognitive decline. Addressing this gap, we have built a portable, plasmonic biosensor-based device using the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) that produce wavelength extinction shifts via a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) signal. The LSPR chip, viewed under a UV/Vis Spectrometer, provides absorbance signals to confirm the detection of our peptides of interest. Compared to currently available diagnostic methods, our device has lower cost and detection time and improved sensitivity. As a result, our device would enable early detection of Alzheimer's disease, and the adoption of efficient management strategies, from lifestyle changes to symptomatic treatments.

In our project, a beta-estradiol induciable system was employed for expression of two transcription factors regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis from Scutellaria baicalensis. An anthocyanin synthesis pathway was constructed in carrot hairy roots and then the hairy roots were induced to produce anthocyanins with high stability, high effectiveness and less hazard. With the culturing of carrot hairy roots in vitro, a controllable way of anthocyanin production was developed.

4400	BFSU-ICUnited	An electrochemical enzyme biosensor for bisphenol A detection	Environmental pollution has always been a critical issue, our project focuses on one of the most widely used chemicals, bisphenol A. Since its advantages in industrial production, bisphenol A has been used in plenty of aspects of the industry. However, the majority of people have nearly no awareness of how BPA is harmful to our health. It is verified to be associated with a variety of diseases. Therefore, investigating a method to detect bisphenol A is crucial. Our detection method is based on displaying tyrosinase on the surface of E. coli, followed by adsorption onto a glassy-carbon electrode. In detail, BPA can be oxidized by tyrosinase and eventually produce an electric signal. By detecting this electric signal, the concentration of BPA can be obtained. Finally, in applications, the results show our detection method can provide a better solution for BPA detection in cost, accuracy, and simplification.

4401	RS_Joint_China	The Devourer: Project-Realising the efficient absorption of lead ions in soil.	Lead is causing severe pollution. It has a negative impact on normal agricultural and forestry production, and crops contaminated by heavy metals can lead to diseases that threaten human’s health. No obvious solution has yet been proposed. Our project is designed to solve this issue by extracting the PtoMYB46, sequence of genes that is proved to have the function of absorbing the lead ions in previous detection, and converting it into poplars’ genes. We firstly extracted genes from the poplars' DNA and amplified the target genes using PCR technique after the detection of its purity and concentration. The cloning vector and expressing vectors were constructed in the second step. Finally, we transferred the gene to the agrobacteria to infect the poplars' leaves. The transgenic poplar improved and perfected the function of absorbing lead ions in poplar. We use directed evolution to further perfect tne function of genes.

4402	RS_United_China	Melabios: A New Friendly Way to Increase Melatonin Production from Plants	The number of people have insomnia keeps increasing for many reasons. Such as colossal workload or addiction to their electronic devices. Taking melatonin, a natural hormone produced in the pineal gland of our brains, will affect one’s sleeping cycle. Our project aims to develop an environmental-friendly and natural way to synthesize melatonin. Melatonin can be found in plants. However, the yield is relatively small. What we try to improve is the yield. We first extract PtoCOMT gene, related to melatonin production, from the poplars' DNA, run gel electrophoresis to test its purity, and then amplify it using polymerase chain reaction. Afterward, we transformed our target gene into two different carriers for storage and expression and transferred them into E.coli. Finally, we changed extracted plasmid into agrobacteria to infect the poplars' leaves, over-expressing our target gene, therefore increasing productivity.we use directed evolution to further perfect tne function of genes.

4403	Bio-Brussels	Biologically inspired functionalisation of endospore appendages for water softening	In this project the Bio-Brussels team looked through many databases in order to find peptides related to biocalcification, examples were found in animals such as corals, sponges, and mollusks. 19 selected constructs were recombinantly introduced in a protein scaffold based on endospore appendages found in different Bacillus species. The functionalization of this scaffold caused a significant decrease in the concentration of free calcium ions, as shown by titration. This decrease could be attributed to 2 different constructs, independent of temperature and protein concentration. This, in combination with TEM images of the protein, introduces the belief that the working mechanism is nucleation based. The team additionally proved that the endospore appendages could be produced by Lactococcus lactis in order to increase safety in further applications.

4404	Goettingen	From Wastegas to Biofuel	The extensive emission of carbon oxides by fossil fuel combustion leads to a rapidly increasing greenhouse effect. Biofuels are providing great potential for sustainable fuels as they are produced from cell material instead of fossil resources. However, these agricultural products compete with food production. Biofuel production utilising CO2 as substrate can contribute to a drastic reduction of greenhouse gases. The acetogenic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of Clostridia utilises CO or Syngas (CO2, CO, H2) as metabolic substrate to produce the central intermediate Acetyl-CoA. Biofuel production by these bacteria failed in the past due to low yields of valuable products. To overcome this obstacle, we introduced metabolic pathway genes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway into a high yield butanol producing organism to generate high biofuel yields from industrial waste gas. Our work presents a sustainable approach for the production of biofuel which is usable for various combustion engines by expressing central metabolic pathway genes.

4405	RDFZ-CHINA	Slimbiotic	Obesity is a serious problem that can lead to several health consequences such as cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and depression. Today, more than 2 billion people are suffering from overweight and obesity worldwide. Meanwhile, existing drug therapy such as Orlistat and Liraglutide has a series of side effects. Therefore, we try to find out an alternative way to treat obesity. Through research, we found that there is a relationship between obesity, microorganisms in the human intestine, and the intestine’s absorption. In our project, we aim to use synthetic biological ways to solve this problem. We engineered E.coli Nissle 1917 and plan to place it in patients’ intestines in the future . These E.coli with enhancing the ability of expression of long-chain fatty acid transporter protein and acetyl-CoA synthetase can intake fatty acid in the intestines, preventing FA to be absorbed by the intestine, therefore losing weight.

Until now, the world has made many efforts on developing new energy sources and technologies, but many of refacing various problems, such as expensive raw materials and the inability of mass-production. Butyl butyrate is a new class of biofuels with high performance. We engineered Clostridium tyrobutyricum to produce both butyric acid and butanol at the same time, and esterify it to form butyl butyrate under the catalysis of lipase. The aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase AdhE2 gene were introduced into C. tyrobutyricum to convert butyryl-CoA to butanol, and the expression of Thl and Hbd were also strengthened at the same time to improve the yield of butyryl-CoA. Using discarded shrimp and crab shells as a kind of nutrient source, the green production process of butyl butyrate from kitchen waste to biofuels is realized.

To overcome the arginine inhibition mechanism, the ArgR gene was knocked out and the ArgJ gene was inserted. To ensure biosafety, we inserted the Lysin gene into our engineered EcN so that it would be lysed after the bacteria had done their work. The engineering bacterium EcN in the project is designed to use the metabolite ammonia of cancer cells as a substrate to continuously produce a large amount of L-arginine in tumors.

4412	UFlorida	In-Vitro Analysis of Lentiviral Vectors with a CRISPR-Cas9 Complex to Target EGFRvIII Receptor in GBM	Glioblastomas are fast-growing and aggressive tumors which can lead to an array of fatal symptoms. Their morphological features, including thread-like tendrils that mesh themselves within the brain’s tissue, make them almost impossible to surgically resect. Although current treatment plans include various surgical and chemical procedures, the prognosis for these treatments remains cumbersome. To address this issue, we’ve aimed genetically modify a second-generation lentivirus coupled with a CRISPR-Cas9 Exon containing-complex to target and reverse an in-frame deletion of the EGFR gene that results in the loss of the ability of the cell to properly regulate proliferation. Ultimately, this may lead to the development of cancerous cells within the brain. In addition, we troubleshooted and created a detailed user guide for an sgRNA prediction software created by GunnVistaPingry_US in 2020. By reintroducing these missing exons to the genome via our lentiviral vector, we hope to introduce a novel treatment for GBM.

In recent years, the development of 3D biological printing has provided a new idea for skin transplantation and brought dawn to patients with skin diseases and skin related industries. In the process of preparing biological ink for 3D printing, materials with good printing adaptability and cell compatibility is the biggest bottleneck at present. As recombinant spider silk protein has low immunogenicity, good cell compatibility and physical crosslinking ability, we set to construct a composite gel based on spider silk bio-ink, and evaluate its potential as a new biomaterials for 3D artificial skin or other scaffold printing or as new wound dressings.

Though timely lifestyle intervention can reduce the risk of these mental diseases, early detection of chronic stress and monitoring stress levels remain difficult. Here we demonstrate a novel cell-based tattoo to detect the rising glucocorticoid level induced by chronic stress and respond with a visible output. We engineered a novel synthetic transcriptional factor that translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus upon glucocorticoid stimulation and initiates reporter gene transcription. We confirmed that the cells carrying this synthetic transcriptional factor and its reporter cassette could respond dose-dependently to glucocorticoid stimulation with either fluorescent or visible colorimetric signals. Our results demonstrate a novel cell-based strategy for monitoring the glucocorticoid levels associated with mental stress, which could help our peers to monitor their stress conditions and therefore assist them in producing better scientific discoveries.

4415	McMaster_A	onCAP: Designing a novel targeted B-cell lymphoma therapeutic gene delivery platform using AAVP vectors	onCAP is a novel, phage-based cancer gene therapy using adeno-associated virus phage (AAVP) vectors to treat B-cell lymphoma. We constructed our phage combining two modified fd-tet plasmids, fMCS and f3-55nm, as well as an expression cassette engineered from the pAAV plasmid to include granzyme B and TNF-?. This plasmid encodes for a phage displaying anti-CD22 short chain variable fragment on its viral coat, which will lead to the release of the plasmid into mammalian cells. Upon plasmid release in human cancer cells, the proteins granzyme B and TNF-? will be expressed to induce cell death. We hypothesize that an AAVP therapeutic will show high specificity for cancerous B cells with limited off-target effects, because our target marker is primarily expressed on B cells and AAVPs are generally well-tolerated by the immune system. Our goal is to create a proof-of-concept demonstrating the potential of phage therapy in targeting aggressive B-cell cancers.

4417	UCL	Biocrafter: The future of sustainable construction	Climate change is the most pressing problem of our generation, causing ecosystem collapse. One of the main contributors that has escaped significant public scrutiny is the construction industry, which accounts for 40% of global CO2 emissions, with 8% due to production of cement. To produce cement, fossil fuelled furnaces heat limestone to 1400 ºC to produce various calcium oxides, releasing 600 kg of CO2 for every tonne of cement produced. To tackle this challenge, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to overexpress urease and carbonic anhydrase enzymes. These enzymes produce carbonate ions from atmospheric or waste stream CO2, which when exposed to free calcium form stratified formation of calcite crystals at the bacterial cell outer surface. The precipitated crystalline calcium carbonate acts as the binding agent within our material, giving it properties comparable to concrete. Using engineered B. subtilis we produced a drop-in replacement of traditional cement to decarbonise this critical industry.

Simultaneously, current use is inefficient as phosphate is lost as runoff and organic waste, eutrophicating waterways and threatening ecosystems and human health. We have developed Pho-Bac, a strain of bacteria Bacillus subtilis, successfully engineered to release phosphate in response to the plant phosphate stress signal malate, thereby acting as an ecologically sensitive biofertilizer. We also attempted to couple release with luxury phosphate uptake, giving Pho-Bac the potential to capture and recycle wastewater phosphate, curbing nutrient pollution and supplying crops with sustainable and locally-sourced phosphate fertilizer, creating a circular phosphate bioeconomy.

It is crucial to predict serotypes for prevention because it contributes to the research of treatments or supplements for vaccines, but the low local diagnosis rate is a problem. Therefore, we create DENV serotype infection detection kit, fluorescent measurement device and epidemic serotype prediction system. In the detection kit, we created single-round infectious particles (SRIP) and SRIP infection detecting cells, which can be detected for infections by measuring fluorescent. In the fluorescent measurement device, which is portable, fluorescent data is sent to the prediction system.

4425	SUSTech_Shenzhen	Tyrian Purple Evolution	We produce tyrian purple dye in E.coli by 3 enzymes: Trp 6-halogenase (Trp 6-Hal), tryptophanase (TnaA) and monooxygenase (MO). Due to TnaA can react with both tryptophan and the first step product bromotryptophan, Fre-SttH and TnaA has to be in two different strains. So the two-cell system, ?TnaA E. coli strain without endogenous TnaA expression and another ?TnaA E. coli strain with extra TnaA expression, are used to produce tyrian purple with less byproduct indigo. We optimize to one-cell system by developing a synthetic phylogeny of programmable Trp repressor with directed evolution to simplify the process of reacting with bromotryptophan not tryptophan. Iterative rounds of positive and negative compartmentalized partnered replication (CPR) led to the exponential amplification of variants that responded with high affinity and specificity to halogenated tryptophan analogs and novel operator sites. We empower cells to perceive the relative ratio of bromotryptophan to tryptophan to control TnaA synthesis.

In the recognition part, we use Convolutional Neural Network for facial emotion recognition,smart bracelet to record heart rate,and finally multimodal emotion judgment through software. In the regulation part, we focus on the sadness emotion, identify the judgment and start the blue light signal, thus stimulating E. coli EL222 photosensitive protein, initiating KdcA and Adh1 to catalyze the synthesis of PPA into phenylethyl alcohol, and releasing it through the aromatherapy system to achieve the emotional calming. Based on the overall closed loop, we further explored more extensions of light sources and emotion regulation, such as anxiety recognition into red light initiation and release of linalool regulation. Also extended such as music, light multi-sensory functions, in order to better assist the odor emotion regulation.

4428	IIT-Delhi	LEADer: Bacterial Biosorbant for Lead Recovery and Whole-Cell Oscillatory Biosensor	According to UNICEF, a third of the world’s children are affected by lead poisoning, a challenge that may even prove to be fatal. Exposure to lead can be via contaminated air, water, food, and consumer products, which makes assessment and monitoring of lead contamination extremely crucial. We comprehensively solve this problem by addressing two needs - detection and recovery. At the low lead concentrations found in groundwater or even wastewater, current recovery methods are inefficient and uneconomical. We perform a comparative study on multiple lead-binding proteins - PbrR, its metal-binding domain and PbrR691 - by expressing them on the surface of Escherichia coli to develop a bacterial biosorbant for lead recovery with the highest degree of cell-surface display, affinity to lead and specificity. Lead, highly recyclable, can be desorbed from the surface for further use, generating value. We are also developing an oscillatory frequency-based whole-cell biosensor for efficient lead detection.

4429	IISER-Pune2_India	AbDEN: Engineered antibody fragments against Dengue	Dengue fever is the most widely spread mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions every year. Despite its devastating effects, no true therapeutic exists against it yet. We used synthetic biology and antibody engineering to address the issue, taking care of the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a pitfall that often causes dengue antibody therapeutics to fail. We designed an engineered antibody fragment that checks all boxes of an ideal therapeutic against Dengue: pan-neutralizing, potent, does not cause ADE, has adequate half-life and is cheap. Our in-silico molecular dynamics simulations helped us probe the ideal geometry, stability and functionality of the drug. In the lab, we further characterized its properties and established an optimal production system using the SHuffle strain of E. coli. Since Dengue is a major issue in India, we made sure to reach out to all possible stakeholders in this endeavor. Their inputs shaped our approach immensely.

Our team aims to investigate microbial BTEX degradation pathways to work towards bioremediation of BTEX contamination. We will do this by cloning characterised gene clusters from environmental isolates of Rhodococcus and Acinetobacter baylii into Escherichia coli and exploring new combinations of the genes in these clusters to better understand them and the function of their enzymes. Work will be undertaken to characterise a transporter often found with these BTEX degradation clusters. From this we aim to create a synthetic optimised BTEX degradation cluster. Additionally, novel and characterised BTEX degradation pathways in Rhodococcus will be studied alongside broad cellular responses to the presence of monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Lastly, we will design and test a fluorescent biosensor that can confirm the presence of BTEX or their metabolite, catechol, in real time.

Therefore, its early-stage detection is critical for timely intervention needed to save the patient’s life. Here we propose a system for more accurate and cost-effective detection of cancer by taking advantage of biomarker sensing together with external electron transfer through a microbial fuel cell. As the final output, we will detect an electrical signal in the presence of a cancer biomarker. Our project relies on the use of a toehold switch biosensor to detect the cancer biomarker PANTR1, a long non-coding RNA, and subsequently express a gene that leads to an electron flow outside the cell resulting in an electric signal. To detect this electric current, we built a microbial fuel cell device connected to an Arduino chip that allows real-time electron transfer measurements with an accuracy higher than fluorescent molecules or chromophores commonly used in such devices.

4433	Linkoping_Sweden	AptaTear - A new approach against Neurodegeneration	Mild traumatic injury, mTBI, is a neurological disorder that causes impaired cognitive function and affects a person’s ability to function independently. More than 100’000 people are affected in Sweden and millions of others worldwide. mTBI can occur at any age due to falls, sport injuries etc. The disease is characterised by increased levels of tau proteins. There is currently a gap in early detection of neurodegeneration related to mTBIs. By using our biosensor in the future, a quick, non-invasive first screening can be done to understand the severeness of the diseases. AptaTear could change the way we detect neurodegenerative diseases as we use tears as our samples rather than spinal fluid. We hope that this would one day reduce the risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease with high severeness and allow patients to maintain most of their life quality.

4434	IIT_Roorkee	CRISPRLY	Cervical Cancer, despite being one of the most preventable cancers if detected in early stages, is still the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. Prevention of Cervical Cancer is very dependent on early detection of the Human Papillomavirus, which virtually causes 100% of the cases. This can be attributed to the lack of a national HPV screening programme and public awareness in rural areas. Available tests are also reliant on expensive equipment that requires trained personnel to results. Detection of the HPV using a simple-and-rapid method is extremely important to take appropriate action against cervical cancer, particularly in areas where healthcare is inaccessible. Our project is a kit for detecting the most oncogenic strain of Human Papillomavirus using the CRISPR Cas12a system producing a visual readout on a lateral flow assay.

To minimize BC production costs, the Unicamp_Brazil team created the Cellulopolis project, which used genomic-scale metabolic model for cellulose production optimization from FBA simulations; these results indicated a set of key genes which lead to BC production increase. The group developed and optimized a toolkit and a methodology for engineering K. rhaeticus AF1 wild-type strain, allowing a light-inducible BC production circuit design. Furthermore, we constructed a low-cost two-step bioreactor for culture growth and BC production destinated for countless applications, such as tissue culture scaffolds.

4436	UIUC_Illinois	Curli Capture: Engineering bacterial biofilms to reduce nitrate pollution.	Nitrate runoff, or the loss of nitrate nitrogen from agricultural systems, can lead to issues such as unsafe drinking water and overgrowth of plant life. To combat this issue, we have designed a nitrate-capture system utilizing curli proteins, which are self-assembling amyloid fibers secreted by E. coli that will form a mesh-like structure upon secretion. Our goal is to fuse the nitrate-capturing protein native to cyanobacteria, nrtA, to the curli monomeric unit, csgA. This fusion will be done with the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, a two-part system that, upon contact, spontaneously forms an isopeptide bond. We are planning our capture system to be a cell-free mesh that can be encapsulated and placed near waterways in agricultural communities. However, we eventually want to modify our construct into a cellular system under the control of an inducible promoter that produces nitrate-capturing curli only in the presence of nitrate.

4437	Calgary	Cellucoat: Keeping foods fresh from the field to your fridge.	Globally, about half of all food produced is not eaten. In Canada, this comes to 50 billion dollars worth of food being wasted. Of all food products, fruits and vegetables have the highest wastage rates, making up 45% of total waste. To tackle this, Cellucoat designed a preservative bacterial cellulose (BC) packaging which can extend the shelf life of fruit and replace current plastic packaging. Our BC is functionalized with antimicrobial properties through recombinant expression of a food safe and antimicrobial peptide called nisin. Since Canada is banning the use of single-use plastics, we are expressing recombinant polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a bioplastic, to strengthen our packaging. For cost-effective production and homogeneous distribution of antimicrobial and strengthening properties, our BC packaging is developed through a coculture between Escherichia coli and Komagataeibacter xylinus. Cellucoat aims to deliver a sustainable antimicrobial packaging to help prolong the shelf life of produce.

Keeping in mind the low concentration of miRNAs in the blood samples, an amplification technique has also been incorporated into the kit. Once detected, the various combinations of biomarkers would give us a fluorescent readout, which can be used for further treatment. We have been in constant touch with our stakeholders, whose valuable inputs helped us modulate our project. We aim to make the process of PCOS diagnosis accurate, efficient, private and secure.

Our well-being depends on other living organisms, therefore, we must find ways to adapt these organisms to the space environment. Our team is focusing on making budding yeast resistant to space radiation. We are engineering yeast to produce melanin, a known chemical that protects cells from both UV and ionizing radiation. To achieve this, we are expressing exogenous tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium. To mitigate potential cytotoxic effects of melanin precursors, we are also aiming to isolate tyrosinase in viral-like nano compartments and alternatively to attach tyrosinase to the outer cell wall. The latter strategy would coat yeast with melanin. These yeasts could be used in spaceships and even other planets to produce valuable compounds for humans.

4442	McMaster_Canada	Developing a tri-input two-cell consortium bacterial biosensor risk assessment tool for major depressive disorder	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that includes symptoms like persistent sadness, and lack of motivation. Currently, diagnosis for MDD includes the DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria, however, there is a need for a risk assessment tool to complement this. Cross-sectional studies show significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy individuals and MDD patients. Of particular interest are the dysregulated bacterial metabolites butyrate, GABA, butyrate, and indole, which have profound effects on the development and progression of MDD, and have a distinct metabolic signature that can be used to profile individuals as having a greater risk for MDD. As such, our team designed a two-cell consortium tri-input biosensor that can assess the levels of each metabolite independently, while also using logic gates to predict overall risk for MDD. Mathematical models of the biosensor were used to validate our system further and identify the system’s sensitivity to baseline concentrations.

4444	UPenn	Photocrete: an optogenetic toolbox to study intercellular communication	Intercellular communication is primarily studied using synthetic protein-level circuits. These circuits currently lack the spatial and temporal control necessary for targeted and time-sensitive applications. To address this gap, we developed Photocrete, a toolbox of protein constructs for light-inducible control of protein display, secretion, and shedding. We expanded upon RELEASE (Vlahos et al.), a modular and generalizable protein circuit which utilizes an ER retention motif and an exogenous protease to control protein secretion. We optogenetically modified RELEASE by replacing different components with the photocleavable protein PhoCl, allowing us to control the mammalian secretion pathway at distinct nodes with finely-tuned light administration regimens. Preliminary results indicate integration of Photocrete into the secretion pathway, but more research is necessary to determine optimal light administration settings. The potential for high spatial and temporal control of Photocrete could allow researchers to perform various signaling studies and develop therapeutics at a new level of precision.

Deep space exploration requires careful resource and capacity management. Manufacture is limited. Based on previously published literature, bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by K.xylinus can be functionalized with chitin by using genes from C.albicans. Thus, we decided to expand on the idea by using bioinformatic analysis to identify and clone homologous genes from S.cerevisiae that should produce a similar end product with broader applications. We propose to make space travel sustainable by using degraded organic waste for the bacteria to synthesize this co-polymer. The process is light independent and space efficient. This new BC could be used as a biodegradable polymer with pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications, as well as an additional source of food. Space Exploration has long inspired scientists to come up with solutions that have uses on Earth, like solar cells, LEDs, etc. The biomanufacturing of our modified BC could also be a means for sustainable waste management.

4451	Sheffield	rEvolver - Vivo La Evolution	Naturally-occurring proteins are often repurposed by synthetic biologists for a wide range of applications, but the performance of these genes typically leaves much to be desired. With rational protein engineering only possible for well-studied genes, directed evolution provides an attractive alternative for real-world optimization. Unfortunately, the labor and time-intensive nature of this approach makes it impractical for smaller labs. To make this technology more widely accessible, we developed rEvolver — a kit for continuous, in vivo directed evolution. At the heart of this kit is a modular plasmid system for both targeted mutagenesis using polymerase-guided base editors and continuous growth-rate-based selection. Complementing the plasmid system is an inexpensive, open-source turbidostat designed to reduce the labor-cost of long-running directed evolution experiments. Finally, to further accelerate evolution, our parts and media have been optimized for use with Vibrio natriegens, a novel chassis organism with a doubling time of less than 10 minutes.

4452	Hopkins	G-Roots: Engineered Magnetotropism for Zero-G Root Growth	With rising interest in resuming spaceflight, plant growth in space is crucial for manned missions as they provide food, oxygen, and atmospheric regulation. Resource scarcity and sustainability is crucial in space, and the cost of sending food to the International Space Station is high. Plants grown in space are unfortunately smaller than their Earth counterparts since gravitropic cues responsible for guiding root growth are absent. Stunted root growth in turn, translates to reduced plant size and diminished caloric value for astronauts. We aim to engineer roots to grow directionally in gradient magnetic fields - magnetotropism.

4453	UPNAvarra_Spain	Zero: A circular economy solution to fight depression	The lately arousal on the relevance of mental health has gained prominence, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic and due to lockdowns. Serotonin, along with dopamine, are both neurotransmitters associated with an individual’s mental well-being. Serotonin in particular serves the functions of mood and sleep regulation, peristaltic movement regulation, sexual function modulation and blood coagulation management. Synthetic biology can take part in the development of novel alternatives to tackle said mental illnesses. By means of circular economy strategies and via innovative DNA constructions, UPNAvarra_Spain team has started a project that will be continued in future editions, aiming the nano-encapsulation of serotonin precursors to be used as dietary supplements to fight these conditions.

4455	ASU	Chlamydomon[As]	People in Arizona still struggle to access clean water due to a history of scarcity and mining contamination. 19% of the drinking wells sampled in Arizona exceed the maximum arsenic level established by the US EPA, threatening the health of those who rely on these water sources. In response, ASU iGEM created Chlamydomon[As], an engineered microalgae capable of bioremediating arsenic from contaminated water. We're enhancing an existing arsenic uptake pathway in C.reinhardtii by introducing arsenate reductase (ACR2p) and phytochelatin synthase (PCS) genes into the C.reinhardtii nucleus. ACR2p reduces incoming arsenic into arsenite, and PCS enhances the cell's ability to bind and sequester arsenite in the vacuole. Multicistronic transgene expression was achieved by developing a tricistronic vector separated by viral 2A peptides that allow independent gene expression under the control of a single promoter. Chlamydomon[As] has the potential to revolutionize bioremediation technologies to solve the issue of arsenic contamination in water.

4457	Portland	Detection of Exogenous c-Myc mRNA Using Genetically Modified E. coli	Current early cancer detection methods are inaccessible for many people due to the cost of materials and instruments (1). Therefore, finding more accessible alternative early cancer detection methods is a top priority. One current method is through the detection of cancerous miRNA in plasma, however, this comes with significant barriers such as high cost related to miRNA sequencing. To address these problems, this project focuses on developing E. coli bacteria that contain conditionally active guide RNA (gRNA) and CRISPR Cas12a aimed at detecting cancerous mRNA in plasma samples. These modified bacteria have the potential to be accessible at any standard diagnostic laboratory, and expected to be cheaper than current equipment.

4458	East_Coast_BioCrew	PCBusters: Here to save the water	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a carcinogen that contaminates waterways due to large-scale industrial dumping. Current methods of detecting and degrading PCBs are either environmentally harmful or expensive. We are developing safe-to-use and accessible methods of detection and degradation of PCBs based on projects from the Stockholm-2020 and Chalmers-Gottenberg-2019 teams. We are genetically engineering both Rhodococcus to enhance its natural ability to degrade PCBs and using yeast to produce bioluminescence when in the presence of PCBs. We contacted the PCB division of the EPA for advice on how we could implement our project. Additionally, we reached out to professors in Maryland who worked on developing a technique to deliver PCB-degrading microbes to contaminated bodies of water. To inform the public about our work, we collaborated with other teams to educate people through classes and social media. Our system, conscious of previous work and health concerns, can mitigate the threat of PCBs.

4459	CUHKSZ	Point-of-Care detection of Nitrite based on nrfA triggered by NarP-dependent regulation in Escherichia coli	Recently, intensive use of nitrite is adversely affecting the environment and human health. However, current detection methods require sophisticated pre-treatment and instrumentation, significantly limiting usage scenarios and increasing detection costs. Our team is therefore motivated to develop a fast, easy-operative solution for portable nitrite determination. Discovering the dissimilatory nitrite reduction pathway within E.coil, we genetically engineered BL21 to overexpress nitrite reductase NrfA to detect nitrite concentration more efficiently in the water, food, and plasma samples. With the E. coli being coated on a paper-based biosensor, electrons produced from nitrite reduction are transferred into an electrical signal and transformed to nitrite concentration after data preprocessing. The result will be shown to every customer, accompanying an evaluation of the sample's safety. Harnessing the power of nature, we lead a step toward a more intelligent, proactive, and environmentally friendly lifestyle.

4460	RUM-UPRM	R-DetoX: Biodegradation of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine to mitigate contamination of the Anones Lagoon in Vieques, Puerto Rico.	Levels of the military-grade explosive RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) exceeding the EPA’s established limits have been detected at the Anones Lagoon in Vieques, Puerto Rico. RDX has shown adverse effects to humans, flora, and fauna, thus posing a risk to the Vieques ecosystem and its inhabitants. We propose a biosensing, cell-signaling module inducible by presence of RDX and coupled to a biodegradation module via the quorum-sensing signal molecule, AHL. We identified two possible biosensing elements in previous works: a transcriptional fusion of two promoters from nitric oxide (NO) detoxification-associated genes, and a synthetic aptamer riboswitch with high affinity for RDX. For the biodegradation module, we identified a P450 cytochrome and reductase duo, XplA/XplB, isolated from bacterial isolates with RDX-degrading capabilities. Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the wetlab work due to an unanticipated meteorological event that left the island without power. We hereby demonstrate our proof of concept and future works ahead.	Environment	Gold Medal		Best Education, Undergrad	2022	Clara E. Isaza	Angelica M.

Halocarbons which include CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs, serve more than 80% of our current refrigerant needs. Contrary to their role in cooling, halocarbons are one of the leading causes of global warming, in addition to ozone depletion. As we are shifting slowly towards greener cooling technologies, we are rendering tons and tons of halocarbons obsolete every year. If left untreated, their emissions can destroy the ecosystem in no time. IISc-Bengaluru aims to develop a sustainable system that can process halocarbons on a large scale. We are incorporating enzyme systems that can degrade most of these gases through a sequential anaerobic-aerobic pathway into the industrial workhorse, Pseudomonas putida. To deliver our remedy to the world, we are designing a cost-efficient bioreactor. With Halocleen, we want to contribute towards preserving the environment for generations to come!

This means that age-related diseases will be frequent among society, imposing serious strains in the health sector. One major hallmark of aging is a gradual increase in chronic low-grade inflammation levels, a process called inflammaging. Knowing that it is a complex process that involves the interaction of several molecules, the goal of TecCCM is to measure the ratio between 3 proinflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-a & CXCL9) and an anti-inflammatory marker (IL-10). We have developed a PoC biosensor that consists of a multiplex lateral flow assay for easy semiquantitative results. The design involves 2 different aptamers for each biomarker, in order to create a sandwich assay able to detect each protein. By creating this geroscience tool we want to empower the health sector and civil society to promote a healthy aging culture.

4466	Stanford	MORPH: Mutation-Optimized Reactor for PET Hydrolysis	Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), accounts for 12% of solid waste worldwide thus making PET processing a top priority. Recently, an enzyme was discovered in bacteria that breaks down PET and following this, several studies have used the wild-type protein to improve its efficiency and stability for enzymatic degradation in vitro. Although these recent achievements are incredible advances, having optimized PETases for conditions that microbes prefer will essentially make PET biodegradable. To produce PETases that function under different conditions (e.g. fermentation), our team is building a platform for producing PETases through continuous directed evolution called “OrthoRep”. To achieve this, we’ve developed a system that selects for yeast mutants with improved activity in user-defined conditions. Our workflow can be used to evolve PETases that work optimally for different species based on the pH and temperature used in our evolution and could be used to evolve enzymes that break down many other materials.

With growing concerns of the increased incidence of more virulent strains resistant to commonly used antifungal drugs, the search for novel alternatives to treating this problem is a priority. Recently, antifungal peptides have been shown to be promising and powerful candidates due to their specificity and efficacy. In alignment with this current research, we employed bioinformatic approaches to scour the highly understudied fungi genome databases and published literature to identify two potential fungal targets, PstSCR1 and Pst_12806, known to be involved in the fungal pathogenesis. After locating known binding partners found naturally in plants, SERK3B and TaISP, respectively, we aimed to design and measure the binding affinity of our predicted peptide sequences as potential antifungal treatments.

As a type of nonrenewable resource, rare earth elements are of great significance to human society, resulting in a substantial global demand. It is estimated that 1 ton of rare earth elements requires an average of 263 tons of water to extract. In addition, the wastewater generated by rare earth mining can have negative effects on our health and the environment. To solve this issue, we designed a brand-new kit based on the project accomplished in 2017. We chose two validated systems, the pmr system and the gols system, to express the functional protein, with both systems modified to detect particular ions in wastewater. The four proteins oprf, Sitag, LanM, and dLBT combine to form a rare earth element concentrator, enabling REE Miner to purify the environment while recollecting these valuable resources.

It utilizes recombinant AAV vector to deliver a novel antigen to tumor cells as a tag, then CAR-T cells targeting the novel antigen would be engineered, which enhances the specificity of CAR target to solid tumour cells. The expression of transgene is expected to be confined to tumor cells by incorporation of tumor-specific promoters, while the addition of two miRNAs would improve CAR-T infiltration and antigen expression. It is hoped that the system would develop into a precision medicine for patients of different tumor types, as the components of the system are customizable depending on the tumour microenvironment of every patient.

Antibiograms are used to detect those pathogens and depend on bacterial growth, stalling the diagnosis. We developed SPEAR - Sensing Pathogens and Emerging Antibiotic Resistance, a point-of-care diagnostic method detecting antibiotic resistances, allowing more accurate treatment. Resistance genes are detected using a split ribozyme fused to guide RNAs (gRNA). The gRNAs bind to the target resistance gene mRNA, activating the ribozyme. It fuses a ribosome binding site and coding sequence of a reporter gene by self-excision, inducing translation of a protein for visible readout. SPEAR robustly and precisely detects several genes of interest. Modular architecture enables fast adaptation to novel resistance genes through exchange of gRNAs.

4475	FSU	Florida’s Manatee and The Search for a Biodegradable Algaecide	The Florida Manatee, an emblematic ketone species in Florida’s fauna, had a record high death toll in 2021. A significant portion of these deaths is due to the increasing frequency of harmful algae blooms in recent years, caused by excess fertilizer runoff into bodies of water. Harmful algae blooms cover the surfaces of bodies of water they pollute, diminishing light penetration and depleting seagrass, the manatee's primary source of food. A recent paper elucidated mechanisms by which the fungal toxin cercosporin can preferentially inactivates cyanobacteria responsible for blooms. Cercosporin acts via permeation of lipid membranes and the production of reactive oxygen species in the presence of sunlight. We inserted the beginning steps of the biosynthetic pathway for cercosporin production into S. Cerevisiae. The goal envisioned by this year's team is to increase product yield, leading the way for biosynthetic mass production serving as an emergency treatment during algal blooms.

4477	Virginia	AtheroSHuffle: A Novel Point-of-Care Detection Method for Early Atherosclerosis	Over 27.6% of the global population suffers from atherosclerosis, a plaque buildup in arteries that causes acute dangerous events like heart attack and stroke after lying dormant for years. Despite high prevalence, current detection methods are costly, time-consuming, and unused during medical visits unless individuals present signs of cardiovascular complications, at which point atherosclerosis is largely irreversible. We describe a method of early, accessible atherosclerosis detection: a lateral flow assay test strip that detects oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a biomarker correlated with early and middle stages of atherosclerosis. Our device provides a rapid, proactive, point-of-care approach to evaluating atherosclerosis risk, allowing early treatment and potential reversal of disease. We employ SHuffle E. coli to produce anti-oxLDL antibodies that integrate into easy-to-read test strips to detect the presence of oxLDL in blood. Our device will provide a sorely-needed low-cost, early detection method for atherosclerosis, improving healthcare globally, especially for under-resourced communities.

4479	Toronto	On-site early diagnostic tool for oak wilt disease using LAMP	Oak wilt is a disease caused by the fungus Bretziella fagacearum that can devastate oak tree populations. According to the Canada Oak Wilt Response Framework, one of the ways to conserve wildlife dependent on oak trees is through early detection and monitoring. The current methodology requires examination of live xylem tissue which is time-consuming, costly, and prone to false negatives. With oak wilt found near the Ontario-Michigan border, there is an urgent need for a rapid, low cost point-of-care diagnostic device to detect oak wilt in Canada. We propose a portable device to extract and detect fungal DNA on site combined with colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), thus, enabling our stakeholders to identify infected oak trees in a timely manner and help slow down the spread of oak wilt.

However, current directed evolution protocols rely on random mutagenesis, consuming disproportionate amounts of time and resources. CARPE, computationally-aided rapid protein engineering, is a faster and more resource-efficient alternative to directed evolution. Using computationally proposed mutations to the active site of the Ste2 GPCR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we engineered Ste2 to recognize the kidney disease biomarker Cystatin-C instead of its native ligand. Evolutionary relationships were explored through pairwise alignments to identify binding residues with high Shannon entropy in Ste2. These target residues were computationally mutated to evolutionarily related amino acids to determine sets of mutations that optimized binding energy to Cystatin-C. To validate results, computationally-favorable mutations were induced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upstream of mVenus to assess binding affinity between CARPE-mutated Ste2 and Cystatin-C.

However, the composition of cinnamon bark is variable from area to area and between different barks, so there is no accurate dose for the medicine. We are in the process of expressing enzymes to produce cinnamic acids, cinnamoyl-CoA, and cinnamaldehyde in E. coli. We will look into producing the intermediates in the phenylalanine-to-cinnamaldehyde pathway in cell-free conditions using the cloned enzymes. Ultimately, these products can be assessed for their ability to remove glycine from body fluids and reduce the symptoms of NKH.

4482	NYC_Empire_State	NeuroTrojan: A fusion protein therapeutic that crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier and promotes post-stroke neural repair	A stroke occurs when blood flow within the brain is blocked. Existing therapies remove blockages but don’t rehabilitate neurons. This is because the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a lining of endothelial cells on the artery, prevents drugs from accessing neurons. We deliver beneficial proteins to neurons by fusing them with HIRMAb (Human Insulin Receptor Monoclonal Antibody), a “biological trojan horse.” NT-3 (Neurotrophin 3) and FGF-2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) are fused to HIRMAb via PCR cloning and Gibson assembly. HIRMAb binds to the insulin receptor on endothelial cells, and through receptor-mediated transcytosis, delivers NT-3/FGF-2 across the BBB. NT-3 or FGF-2 then binds to its respective receptor. We developed a transwell assay to test that our fusion proteins cross the BBB and an interaction assay to determine their interaction with their receptor. Our research demonstrates a relevant mechanism for crossing the BBB and can be adapted to other neurodegenerative diseases.

4483	UMaryland	Nitrate Neutralizer	"The rapidly deteriorating health of the Chesapeake Bay is a consistent problem in Maryland. An overabundance of nutrients directly leads to harmful algal blooms (HABs) and contaminates the water that both wildlife and we depend on. Increased nutrient pollution and the toxins associated with HABs are harmful to the environment, human health, and the economy. Having previously targeted phosphorus in 2021, our team seeks to target the most soluble nutrient pollutant; however, current strategies do not prioritize reuse, which is problematic since nitrogen synthesis contributes to agricultural unsustainability. UMaryland iGEM’s solution is to engineer E. coli to increase its capacity for storing nitrogen as cyanophycin granule polypeptides (CGP). Our design also includes the ability to hydrolyze CGP into nitrogen-rich amino acids for reuse. To ensure our design efficacy and its utility, our team engaged with experts and stakeholders who want to decrease nutrient pollution and promote agricultural sustainability."

The bacterial enzymes PETase and MHETase work synergistically to degrade PET into the environmentally benign monomers terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. Although there has been much effort toward highly efficient plastic degradation, a systematic approach using protein engineering and strain engineering to improve plastic degradation is still required to achieve practical applications. Our first completed goal was the surface display of PETase and MHETase enzymes in E. coli using transporter proteins for the creation of whole-cell biocatalysts, eliminating the need for costly and time intensive enzyme purification. Secondly, to evaluate changes in effectiveness we developed qualitative and quantitative high-throughput kinetic assays. Finally, we used small trials of DNA mutagenesis to create and evaluate modified enzymes as a proof of concept for improving enzyme functions including PETase in future works.

4486	Yale	Biosynthesis of an Optimized (S)-equol Pathway in Gut Microbial Species for Probiotic Health Applications	Menopause is a natural part of a healthy life marked by a decrease in estrogen levels. This transition can bring about uncomfortable, sometimes debilitating symptoms. Within the gut microbiome are bacteria that produce products such as equol, an isoflavandiol that mimics estrogen in the body. Equol has been shown to be an effective treatment to relieve menopause symptoms however, the monthly cost for the necessary dosage is unreasonably expensive. Additionally, gut microbiomes vary from individual to individual so not all individuals are able to naturally produce equol at effective rates. As the median age of women increases across the globe, issues which arise during menopause become more prevalent. To combat this issue, we sought to improve the rate at which Adlercreutzia equolifasciens and other gut microbial species produce equol. Demonstrated feasibility of these engineered organisms can then be utilized for future use in probiotic supplements as an affordable menopause treatment.

4487	KAIT_JAPAN	Effective Biosynthesis of Cannabidiol via Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Stress can affect all parts of our life, including our emotions, behaviors, and physical health. These symptoms can be eased by using a substance called CBD. CBD is known to have relaxing and anti-inflammatory effects. CBD is extracted from hemp. The methods of extraction are complicated and costly. Therefore, CBD infused products are expensive. Our main goal is to produce CBD efficiently via Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The production of CBD requires two substances. These substances are, geranylgeranyl-PP(GPP) and olivetolic acid (OA). During the production of GPP, two rate-limiting enzymes are present. Therefore, by overexpressing these enzymes, we expect an increase in the production yield. OA should be added to the culture medium to produce CBD. However, OA is expensive. Therefore, we thought of producing OA in S. cerevisiae. We believe that this method of CBD production can be cost and yield effective. Therefore, making CBD infused products more affordable for consumers.

4488	Sydney_Australia	Developing new in vitro methods for directed evolution of nanobodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications	Nanobodies are epitope-binding fragments from camelid heavy-chain antibodies. They possess antigen-binding qualities typical of whole antibodies but are smaller, more robust, with lowered immunogenicity. Hence, nanobodies are frequently used in medical and research applications like tumour-targeting therapies and ELISA assays. However, nanobody technologies are limited by the requirement of live animal hosts for development and the extensive research time for producing new nanobodies in response to rapidly mutating or diverse antigens (e.g. SARS-CoV2). Our project proposes using synthetic biology for novel nanobody discovery in vitro through DNA-shuffling. This method uses homologous recombination to generate extensive mutant nanobody gene libraries which are screened for useful affinities or specificities using an E.coli surface display system passaged over target antigens immobilised on cellulose via cellulose-binding domains. This removes animals from the development process, allowing for faster, ethical nanobody deployment, for use in technologies like lateral-flow tests to detect emerging coronavirus variants.

It presents a particular problem in fields such as metabolic engineering, where fluxes through pathways must be tightly controlled; or microbial drug delivery, where consistent levels of drug release would be required. To counter this inherent variability, we are using control theory to create a set of standardised integral controllers, tailored for different protein expression levels, to reduce steady state error. Using a combinatorial approach, we are designing, testing and modelling a variety of circuits, to build a user-friendly robust adaptation platform. Our system will allow simple one step cloning of the gene of interest into the circuit, and choice of circuit with a desired output level and feedback properties. This allows for wide application, as any protein of interest can be easily inserted into the circuit and held at a reference production level."

Microalgae can be used to produce biofuels while consuming harmful environmental agents, such as carbon dioxide and wastewater. Our goal is to create a synthetic biology system that will increase lipid production from microalgae to serve as an intermediate in chemical reactions needed to create biofuels. Specifically, we will create a co-culture between C. minutissima microalgae and E. coli to increase the cell density of C. minutissima. To increase C. minutissima’s growth rate, E. coli will be genetically modified to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). C. minutissima will be genetically modified to express glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), and diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT) to increase lipid production. We hypothesize that these factors will create a dense algae population with high lipid content, providing ideal parameters for biofuel production.

Personalized medicine, which allows therapies to be adapted to individual patients, provides promising attempts for fighting cancer diseases. A well known approach is Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. However, this emerging treatment is limited by its specificity, with off-tumor responses causing severe side-effects in patients. With our approach – SpecifiCAR – we aim to improve specificity of CAR T-cell therapy utilizing distinctive factors of the tumor microenvironment. Our project involves targeting of acidic pH and CD8+ cell clustering around solid tumors. We are using modern tools of the synbio toolbox to introduce an inducible loop facilitating quorum sensing of CAR T-cells. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of a pH control mechanism for CAR activation. To help facilitate future projects involving CARs we have developed a software tool to streamline the design of the receptors.

According to a survey, one billion people worldwide are suffering from fungal skin diseases today. Therefore, finding an innovative and efficient way to treat fungal skin diseases is urgent. To kill the fungi on the skin, we intend to degrade the chitin in the fungal cell wall by using chitinase to destroy its structure. However, most common chitinases on the market have only one degradation domain and thus have a weak binding ability. In this case, they cannot work efficiently. To solve this problem, our team used synthetic biology to bind chitinase binding domains extracted from two bacteria to the N and C ends of our chitinase, respectively, to obtain modified chitinase with strong binding ability.

Nitrates can make their way into water bodies due to fertilizer use in agriculture or industrial activity. This creates an unpleasant smell and look and blocks sunlight from reaching marine life inside the water, killing plants and leading to the destruction of marine life. The foul smell can avert tourists, which can devastate small businesses that rely on seasonal income. This is why we are designing a filter to convert the nitrates into an indigestible form of nitrogen that can’t be utilized by these microbes, stopping eutrophication. We will achieve this by expressing the gene responsible for the production of nitrate reductase in E. coli, and harvesting the enzymes.

4510	Bonn-Rheinbach	Cyan Energy: Biofuel from Cyanobacteria	Cyanobacteria has the capability to produce hydrocarbons such as alkane, which could be utilized in jet fuel. One existing problem is that long chain alkanes tend to precipitate due to hydrophobic interactions. A possible solution to this is HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids-Synthetic Paraffin Kerosene), a commonly used drop in. The HEFA-SPK pathway requires free fatty acids to be converted into alkane and eventually branched alkanes through hydrotreatment. By this hydrotreatment, alkane isoforms with more branches would be generated reducing the hydrophobic interactions. The enzymes aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) and acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) in cyanobacteria have been confirmed to be responsible for catalyzing the production of hydrocarbon. In order to optimize the expression of the two enzymes, expressions of other less important enzymes are inhibited, while overexpressing the forementioned two enzymes with the help of plasmid transformation. This could bypass the first step of HEFA pathway, thereby optimizing production.

4511	HUS_United	A new type of biological parts: degradation-tuning RNAs	Enhancing gene expression is vital for downstream applications such as biosynthesis of valuable chemicals or manipulating behaviors of designed gene circuits against intrinsic noise. The traditional means is to adopt promoters with higher activity to increase the inflow of mRNA and protein translation, which inevitably increases metabolic pressure for the chassis, thus limiting the scale and complexity of artificial biological circuits. Instead of increasing gene expression, we seek to modulate the degradation rate of mRNA by degradation-tuning RNAs (dsRNAs) on the 5’UTR region of the mRNAs, which function by promoting or inhibiting the attack from endogenous RNases. It allows us to enhance protein expressions without posting an extra metabolic burden to the host, and we introduce these functional structures on mRNA to synthetic biology as a new type of standard biological parts.

4513	RBHS_SanDiego_CA	Modeling Pteris Vittata’s Arsenic Sequestration Mechanism	"Our project is to model an important part of Pteris Vittata’s fern sequestering mechanism in order to evaluate the feasibility of implementing it in other plants for phytoremediation as a way to tackle the issue of arsenic toxicity. Pteris Vittata, also known as the Chinese Brake Fern, is an arsenic hyperaccumulator that absorbs arsenic from the soil and transfers it from root to shoot for sequestration in vacuoles. Our model consists of three critical enzymes: PvARC2, PvPHT1;3, and PvACR3. Arsenic, when in the form of arsenate, travels through PvPHT1;3, which is a phosphate transporter in the cell membrane, into the cytosol of the cell. After that, PvACR2, a reductase in the cytosol, reduces the arsenate to arsenite; PvACR3, an antiporter, then induces arsenic sequestration in the vacuoles. By modeling this arsenic sequestering mechanism, our goal is to provide a solution for arsenic contamination in the environment."

4514	MiamiU	Synthesizing a SynPhage Against Antimicrobial Resistance	Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a growing public health problem resulting in ~35,000 mortalities each year in the United States. However, new antibiotics require decade(s) of research and development. Therefore, our goal is to develop an antimicrobial platform that is highly programmable for targeting emerging threats or new antibiotic resistant mutants. Our therapeutic platform, SynPhage, has two-levels of programmability. The first is genetic programmability to target AR or virulence genes using CRISPR-Cas. The second level is to control which bacteria receive CRISPR-Cas by engineering T7 transducing particles to display a nanobody selective for pathogenic bacterial receptors on the tail fiber complex using a sortase (SrtA) mediated post-translational functionalization strategy. This post translational attachment allows for proper folding of the tail fiber complex prior to nanobody attachment, as AlphaFold modeling predicts complex misfolding for direct protein fusions. Overall our new synthetic biological system serves as a foundation for modular therapeutics against AR.

4515	East_China	N-Butanol Cell Factory	N-butanol, an organic compound (C4H10O). There is a larger demand for N-butanol than before. N-butanol can take advantage of its organic compounds to help transport hydrogen and reduce the waste of electricity, while also being a less polluting fuel. However, there are many disadvantages to the traditional N-butanol manufacturing process. Thus, our purpose is to produce N-butanol more efficiently by biosynthesis as well as be more friendly to the environment. Below is the method, Streptomyces acetobutyrate genes thl, hbd, crt, and streptomyces dentatus ter need to be cloned into plasmid expressing butanol synthetic pathway proteins. The plasmid carrying these genes with optimized codon will be introduced into the target strain through electrical transformation to test whether the transformants can successfully synthesize N-butanol.

4516	Jiangsu_United	Targeting FoxO1 for anti-T2DM drug development	Approximately 537 million people around the world suffer from diabetes, while 90% of which are type 2, such disease affects the body’s response or production of insulin, thus limiting one’s capability of controlling blood sugar levels. Current solutions to this potentially fatal condition are accepted as commonplace in their treatment. However, this inaccessibility to life-saving medicine prompted us to find an alternative to treating symptoms of type 2 diabetes. We constructed a drug screening platform targeting FoxO1, a primary controller for glucose production. And it was successfully screened that compound 355 has the activity of inhibiting the FoxO1 gene. This compound provides a root solution for diabetes, lowering glucose levels in the blood without the need for insulin.

Clean Heat, developed by the Ionis-Paris team, offers a grounbreaking solution to this problem via the genetic modification of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the sraox gene. The latter is responsible for the thermogenic properties of Symplocarpus foetidus that can produce a 35°C heat differential. At the same time, water pollution by alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a pervasive endocrine disruptor that threatens human health and biodiversity. Inspired by the 2021 HiZJU iGEM team, Sinorhizobium meliloti is genetically modified by our team using the amoA and hao genes to degrade EE2 molecules. By its ability to produce vitamin B12, this strain is known to increase C. reinhardtii heat resistance.

Our project aims to fight bacterial plant pathogens using microcins, an emerging class of antimicrobial peptides that many bacterial species secrete as a weapon for interspecies competition. To protect crops from bacterial pathogens, we engineered a modular system for secreting microcins from a plant symbiont to kill a target pathogen. Our system utilizes two plasmids. The first encodes the secretion system proteins required for export of the microcins. The second plasmid expresses the microcin and its immunity protein which confers resistance to microcin toxicity. This modular and easily reprogrammable system can potentially protect crops from a broad range of bacterial plant pathogens. Overall, we identified novel microcins in the genomes of plant pathogens, cloned examples from three different pathogen families, and tested the effectiveness of 9 identified microcins against onion pathogens.

4581	Guangxi-U-China	Engineered Bacteria with Nano-Immunomodulator for Precision Therapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer	Triple negative breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype with poor prognosis and high risk of recurrence. The treatment is challenging because of limited chemotherapy responses, lack of actionable targets and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors-based therapies. In particular, the acidic and hypoxic microenvironment caused by the high glycolytic activity of tumor cells promotes the non-inflammatory polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. The proposed immunotherapy approach combines genetically engineered bacteria with manganese dioxide nanospheres that function as chemical nano-immunomodulators to re-boost macrophage-driven anti-tumor responses. It remodels the acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment and relieve oxidative stress. An unsupervised centroid-based learning algorithm is developed to elucidate proteomic and metabolic evolution of bacteria living in lactic acid. A portable ultrasound device is designed for self-checking of breast health. We hope that our educational and social services can improve human life and change the world.

We've integrated genetically modified bacteria into this device to remove formaldehyde from the environment oxidatively. These bacteria express non-natural cofactor (NCD)-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. To ensure their efficient function, we've introduced the NCD synthase system to alleviate competition for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Additionally, we've incorporated a modified malic enzyme into the pathway to maintain the amount of NCD, enabling stable operation of the formaldehyde metabolic pathway. This comprehensive solution offers an effective and safe approach to combat formaldehyde pollution.

4597	Guelph	Project BloomBiota: Combatting vitamin B12 Deficiency with probiotic-expressed gastric intrinsic factor	Project BloomBiota aimed to create a probiotic containing enriched B12 and human gastric intrinsic factor (hGIF) to combat vitamin B12 deficiency, which disproportionately affects women, vegetarians, and the elderly. Through one pill containing the probiotic strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, an individual receives a B12 supplement and increased absorption. BloomBiota is novel because it aims to express hGIF in the bacterial periplasm instead of the cytoplasm, which increases the chances for proper folding, resulting in a functional protein. Ultimately, the project's goal was not achieved. However, several new parts were contributed to the registry and an impressive and affordable model of a probiotic pill-packing machine was created. When attempting to transform E. coli Nissle 1917 with a BAC containing the B12 cluster and the plasmid containing hGIF, it would be advisable to use CRISPR to remove the pre-existing plasmids, allowing facilitated uptake of the large, engineered BAC.

The biosensor design is based on work done by Stewart Loh's lab and the 2013 Uppsala iGEM team. The designed biosensor has the potential to detect a variety of ligands, our focus is on creating a biosensor to detect one of the most serious health problems of captive marine fish. Velvet disease is caused by Amyloodinium dinoflagellate parasites. The parasite enters the slime coat of a host fish and damages the host's cells. Fish farmers and pet owners would benefit from having a rapid test that is able to detect parasite levels early. The biosensor will be engineered to change colour upon binding to a target protein produced by the parasite. The user-friendly lateral flow assay will not require any specialized equipment and have a long shelf life.

4601	Evry-Paris-Saclay	OptoGenEYEsis	"Imagine a world without sight - a harsh reality for many. The retina, a specialized tissue at the back of the eye, houses photoreceptor cells, each containing opsin molecules that respond to light, a crucial element in vision. The loss of these cells leads to the depletion of opsins, resulting in blindness. OptoGenEYEsis is a pioneering tool that leverages light-sensitive microbial opsins for genetic therapy. Our aim is to rejuvenate the retina's light-sensing abilities and restore vision. Unlike other microbial opsin-based treatments which suffer from narrow absorption spectra, suboptimal sensitivity, and limited efficiency in converting light into nervous electrical signals, our approach uses synthetic biology and microfluidics-based directed evolution for enhanced opsins. This innovative approach promises improved light absorption, heightened sensitivity, and efficient conversion of light into electrical signals for visual processing. It's more than just a solution; it's a game-changer in the fight against blindness."

Our iGEM team aimed at solutions by understanding the needs and constraints for a sustainable solution from all stakeholders (public health, NGOs, patients). Lubritect leverages the power of naturally occurring lubricant, mucin, and the generative power of AI, to inform a product that is safe, effective and easy to handle. We combine a mucin-based hydrogel, shown to reduce transmission rates of HIV and HSV with AI-generated protein structures designed through RF-diffusion, to bind to surface proteins and catch target pathogens. This approach potentially circumvents the evolution of pathogenic escape mechanisms by using protein structures not found in nature. We hope to generate a personal lubricant product which can entrap pathogens, significantly reducing their transmissibility.

4604	Freiburg	CELLECT - Self-Regulating System to Ensure Phenotypic Stability in Microbial Cultures	Phenotypic instability in microbial cultures severely limits the applicability of synthetic biology. Be it for plastic degradation or vitamin synthesis, persistent gene expression is a must. Therefore, we have created CELLECT, an innovative autoregulatory system that makes microbial survival dependent on the existence of a target molecule. The system integrates a riboswitch, specific to the target compound, linked to a toxin-antitoxin mechanism that regulates cell survival. The binding of the target molecule to the riboswitch inhibits downstream toxin gene expression, allowing the cell to persist. Conversely, in the absence of the target compound, toxin levels steadily increase, resulting in cell death. CELLECT's versatile design makes it applicable across diverse host organisms for the optimization of microbial production or degradation of any compound. We employed computational models to predict system performance in laboratory experiments and demonstrated its functionality through the continuous bioproduction of vitamin B12 in E. coli.

4605	Nanjing-China	Rainboweaver?Creating vibrant cellulose fibers, dedicated to fostering sustainable growth within the fashion industry	In today's fast fashion industry, an astonishing 100 billion new garments are manufactured worldwide annually. Unfortunately, the process of dyeing clothing with lipophilic dyes like indigoidine stands out as the most detrimental environmental factor within production cycle. Rainboweaver endeavors to present a truly innovative solution. Building upon previous iGEM research, firstly, we optimized K.xylinus cultivation for bacterial cellulose and created a metabolic pathway in C. glutamicum for indigoidine production. Secondly, we proposed two approaches: 1) Establishing a co-cultivation system. To ensure color uniformity, we explored agitated cultivation of indigoidine-producing C. glutamicum with BC-producing K.xylinus or directly using BC as a scaffold for C. glutamicum cultivation. 2) Introducing enzymes associated with indigoidine metabolism into K.xylinus for direct synthesis of colored fibers. Providing a groundbreaking solution to address pollution in the fashion industry, our project represents a paradigm shift by integrating cellulose production and dye synthesis into a single system.

4606	Nanjing-NFLS	Joint Guardian	Osteoarthiritis and Obesity are two major health problems prevalent in our society nowadays. Obesity increases the risk of OA in both weight-bearing (knee) and non-weight-bearing (hand) joints, and obesity doubles the lifetime risk of OA. An efficient new therapeutic target for osteoarthritis related obesity is of urgent need. Adipose tissue can secrete more exosomes in the obese condition, which have been reported to play an important role in inter-organ communication and regulate the functions of joints. Micro-RNA, a small non-coding RNA, is an important component of exosomes that function as guide molecules in RNA silencing. Our project utilizes TargetScan software and luciferase reporter plasmid to validate its target gene in the obese exosomal micro-RNA. The inhibition of the highly expressed adipocyte exosomal micro-RNA can greatly reduce its harm on the joint and be an ideal way for anti-Obesity and joint guardian.

4608	McGill	Proteus - A programmable and modular oncogene targeting and pyroptosis inducing system	Prevalence of cancer has been on the rise in the last twenty years, with cancers like pancreatic cancer still not improving in terms of treatment options. We engineered a novel, personalized therapeutic technique. A personalized treatment modality restricts negative off-target effects, ideally killing cancerous cells before surgical resection becomes the only viable treatment. We utilize the newly discovered CRISPR system, Craspase, to engineer forced pyroptotic cell death among cancerous cells. Craspase is a CRISPR RNA-guided, RNA activated protease, which mediates our personalized therapeutic approach. Our team takes advantage of the high homogeneity of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer to design a genetic-level therapeutic that targets the cancer at its root, rather than targeting hallmarks of cancer. We designed modular parts for our project in hopes of engineering a novel therapeutic for many different manifestations of cancer, and perhaps more generally any disease propagating through RNA.

4610	CCA-San-Diego	FUMigate: A Novel Salmon Antiparasitic	Parasites of freshwater salmonids exert significant economic damages to the aquaculture industry, being associated with an annual cost of some $1.05 billion to $9.58 billion (Shinn et al, 2015). Notwithstanding this economic impact, these parasites are unable to cause notable disease in humans, and are often overlooked in the broader effort to develop antiparasitic diagnostics and therapeutics. The salmon industry, being the fastest-growing means of food production worldwide, is particularly impacted by parasitic infection (Iversen et al, 2020). We aim to produce an antiparasitic natural product within fish by delivering to them a series of genes packaged in environmentally-degradable chitosan nanoparticles. The antiparasitic compound being considered is fumagillin, which has demonstrated activity against the parasitic species Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, nucleospora salmonis, loma salmonae, and myxobolus cerebralis. We seek to reconstitute the fumagillin pathway by administering antiparasitic gene therapy to affected fish by delivering genes through the nanoparticles in fish feed.

We employed comprehensive bioinformatics methods to identify a breast cancer-associated miRNA, miR-21-5p, as an optimal biomarker for screening, and engineered a CRISPR/Cas13a system that could be specifically activated by miR-21-5p to cleave any by-stander RNA such as a dual-labeled reporter RNA. We used a lateral flow strip to show the cleavage of the reporter RNA, as only the intact reporter RNA could cause accumulation of colloidal gold at the T line of this strip. Our BreFast combines the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas13a system and the convenience of lateral flow strips into a novel approach to detect breast cancer.

Traditional chemical synthesis methods generate substantial industrial waste, posing environmental challenges. To address these issues, we have designed a yeast-based cell factory capable of environmentally-friendly, controllable fragrance production. Our approach leverages the power of light regulation using a photosensitive transcription regulator, EL222, and a specific promoter, PC120. The 450nm light triggers the expression of essential genes for the synthesis of sclareol, while represses those for santalol. This dynamic photoinduction system offers advantages such as operational reversibility, high spatiotemporal resolution, and enhanced production efficiency. Our experiments indicate that our cell factory can potentially produce fragrant bases with precise proportions of santalol and sclareol. This breakthrough promises a more sustainable and flexible future for fragrance production.

4635	NEU-CHINA	Functional biofilms applied in metal corrosion protection	In metal corrosion protection, biofilm can play a role in metal corrosion protection by removing corrosive cathode medium (such as oxygen), inhibiting the growth of corrosive microorganisms, and forming a protective layer on the metal surface. However, one of the shortcomings of biofilm for metal corrosion protection is its weak metal adhesion ability. NEU-CHINA team aimed to design a living functional biofilm that can be applied to marine metal corrosion protection. We named it BMCP (Biofilm for metal corrosion prevention). In this project, Escherichia coli amyloid protein CsgA and mussel foot silk protein Mfp were connected by in vitro assembly, aiming at improving the adhesion ability of the biofilm on the surface of metal materials, so as to play the role of corrosion protection better. Finally, we will achieve long-term metal corrosion protection and improve the biological safety of BMCP through biomineralization.

4636	NTHU-Taiwan	NanoCircDx	Research has demonstrated that early detection can make colorectal cancer highly curable. Therefore, we have decided to develop a diagnostic technology platform for cancer screening using liquid biopsy. With just a blood sample provided by the patient, we can determine the potential presence of colorectal cancer through circular RNA analysis in the serum. NanoCircDx presents clear benefits compared to existing methods for colorectal cancer detection. Our approach needs just one blood sample to evaluate the potential of colorectal cancer, offering: 1. Early identification of the disease. 2. Enhanced accuracy and speed in screening. 3. Greater user acceptance. 4. Minimal invasive procedure. Current circular RNA detection methods are limited to lab settings and lack rapid screening. Our study has great potential to establish swift circular RNA biomarker screening for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we intend to expand this concept for diagnosing diverse diseases and their related circular RNAs in the future.

4638	PekingHSC	Neuraminidase-boost Influenza Virus to Target Tumors with TFR1 high expression	Cancer is a great threat to human health, and the development of new antitumor therapies is imminent. Studies have shown that TfR1 (transferrin receptor 1) is highly expressed in many types of tumor cells, and it is also found that influenza virus uses the internalization pathway of TfR1 to achieve virus endocytosis, and this process is produced by the interaction between NA protein (neuraminidase) on the surface of the virus and TfR1. For the wild-type influenza virus, the number and length of the surface NA protein is less than the HA protein (hemagglutinin), which makes the identification of NA protein more difficult. Our work is to increase and lengthen the NA protein on the surface of the virus through genetic engineering, so that the NA protein is more easily recognized by tumor cells with high expression of TfR1, so as to improve the tumor targeting of influenza virus.

4639	Patras	Hyperion	Project Hyperion is a pioneering venture focused on developing a cutting-edge biosensor with a primary objective: early cancer detection and the identification of various anomalies through the analysis of kinome hyperphosphorylation patterns. Our journey commences with the precise construction of the biosensor and its components, primarily executed through advanced 3D printing techniques. Concurrently, we initiate the cultivation of human cell lines, specifically employing the A453 cell lines sourced from the European Collections of Authenticated Cell Cultures, forming the foundation for rigorous testing and critical assessment of the biosensor's functionality. In the subsequent phase, we meticulously extract proteins from these cell lines to evaluate hyperphosphorylation patterns through established techniques such as Western blotting. We ascertain the biosensor's capacity to accurately detect these patterns, marking a pivotal step toward transforming cancer diagnosis and anomaly detection. Project Hyperion is poised to revolutionize healthcare, standing at the forefront of innovative biotechnology.	Diagnostics				2023	George P.

4641	MIT-MAHE	CarbanEl	MIT-MAHE is focusing on biodegrading triclocarban (TCC), an antimicrobial compound in pharmaceutical and personal care products. Due to its hydrophobicity and chemical stability, it is ineffectively degraded in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), resulting in accumulation in the effluent and sludge. Owing to its carcinogenic and hormone disrupting properties, TCC when exposed to the environment as sludge inhibits plant metabolism and harms endocrine functioning in aquatic life. CarbanEl aims to degrade triclocarban into non-toxic byproducts. The aim is to introduce Ochrobactrum TCC-2's TccA gene which can degrade TCC into a chassis which can inherently degrade the toxic chloroaniline byproducts using its natural, existing pathways. We decided to focus our study on P. putida, P. fluoroscens, and A. baylyi, which are all suitable candidates to serve as our chloroaniline-degrading chassis. This will effectively lower the impact of TCC on our environment, locally and globally, in aquaculture, agriculture, and human health.

Currently, tests for common conditions in women’s health are rudimentary and invasive, with women often not receiving a diagnosis for many years after the onset of symptoms. Project Genoswitch aims to spread awareness about women’s health and to develop a modular cell-free diagnostic test that can decrease the length of time to receive a diagnosis, by detecting upregulated microRNA biomarkers in the bloodstream, using four toehold switches in one composite gene fragment, which can each detect three upregulated microRNAs in the serum of patients with the condition. Our test specifically targets PCOS, endometriosis, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, although it can be used more widely. This test will provide a more cost effective and non-invasive approach compared to current methods, increasing the accessibility of miRNA biomarker tests worldwide.

4645	HZAU-China	C.A.T: Cat Allergic Therapy	Feline allergies are a common source of allergens, affecting up to 15% of adults and children and causing symptoms from allergic rhinitis to severe asthma. Feline allergens, Fel d1 (Felis domesticus allergen 1), are mainly produced by the salivary glands, and when cats groom themselves, Fel d1 is transferred from saliva to their hair, and cat dander containing Fel d 1 allergen is then spread to the environment as small airborne particles. HZAU-China team this year designed C.A.T: Cat Allergic Therapy. As a novel therapy for cat allergy, the chassis bacteria, genetically programmed to adhere to the saliva pellicle of cats, produce two single-chain fragment variables (scFvs) and secrete them outside the cell. These scFvs block the immune response caused by the antigen and prevent allergies. The project aims to develop an edible probiotic cat nutriment, which is expected to be used for prevention and treatment of feline allergy.

4646	Duke	ICARUS - Intelligent Chimeric Antigen Upregulation System	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown great promise in treating certain hematologic cancers by reprogramming patient T-cells to target tumor antigens. However, application of this therapy to solid tumors has been limited by issues such as heterogeneity of antigen expression, tumor inaccessibility, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Our project describes an integrated CAR-synNotch circuit, the Intelligent Chimeric Antigen Receptor Upregulation System (ICARUS), to address these limitations. This system utilizes engineered T-cells that secrete custom antigens to activate endogenous synthetic receptors and to amplify CAR T-cell stimulation, proliferation, and cytotoxicity. By enhancing T-cell stimulation through autocrine and paracrine signaling, ICARUS aims to improve CAR T-cell efficacy against solid tumors. This innovative gene circuit represents a novel approach to overcome current challenges in CAR T-cell therapy for solid cancers.

4649	EastCoastBioCrew	RhizeUP: Engineering Rhizobium to Combat the Root of Nutrient Runoff	Modern agricultural practices rely heavily on phosphate fertilizers. However, due to the tendency of phosphate to bond with minerals in the soil, most phosphate molecules exist in a form unusable to plants. These mineral phosphates are a driving force behind the nutrient pollution and runoff in waterways that leads to algal blooms. RhizeUP aims to engineer Rhizobium tropici, a nutrient-fixing soil bacteria known for its high tolerance to environmental stresses and which is a successful microsymbiont of several legumes. We are increasing phosphate solubility to increase plant uptake and to remove excess phosphate from the soil. Our goal is to introduce the PQQ + gdc genes which secrete gluconic acid that chelates mineral phosphates. Additionally, we utilized a codon-optimized pstSCAB operon, high-affinity phosphate transporter proteins, to transport phosphate into the cell. We believe these pathways will effectively modify rhizobacteria to decrease phosphate runoff and reduce the need for phosphate fertilizer.

4650	KCIS-Xiugang-Taipei	Brew to First Aid: An environmental-friendly answer to leather	"The leather industry is harmful to the environment: endangered animals are killed for products, cattle needed for leather produce greenhouse gases; chemicals used to process animal skin pollute the environment and create health problems for workers involved. This inspired us to tackle the leather industry with a more sustainable approach: SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). SCOBY contains lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid, bacteria, and yeast, and forms a bacterial cellulose membrane by tangling secreted cellulose fibrins. This cellulose membrane can be used as a replacement for animal leather, however, dried SCOBY is very rigid, which makes it undesirable for use in creating certain leather products. Our design creates overexpression of spider-silk proteins (MaSP-1 MaSP-2) (to enhance flexibility) in conjunction with cellulose binding domain (CBD) (to join the proteins to the SCOBY) in yeast. It is then co-cultured with regular SCOBY membrane to create a more flexible product."

4651	DNHS-SanDiego-CA	PlastiFind	Every year around 20 million tons of plastic waste leaks into aquatic ecosystems. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a commonly used thermoplastic resin. Global accumulation of plastic can be counteracted by improving PET degradation in the environment. However, scientists currently lack efficient methods to measure PET hydrolysis, making it difficult to research further in this field. The goal of this project is to develop a sensitive plasmid biosensor to detect terephthalic acid (TPA), a byproduct of PET hydrolysis. The TPA-sensitive plasmids were built using a variety of promoters, importers, and reporters. Use of the MucK importer, mEmerald fluorescent protein, and changing the promoter’s -35 and -10 sigma factors to match that of promoter pTPA3 demonstrated the highest increase. The optimal binding configurations with TPA were predicted via molecular docking to support the results. This research makes important contributions to the field of plastic degradation as a whole.

By constructing Cas12a and crRNA vectors, the reverse cleavage function of CRISPR technology was used to release fluorescent signals and complete miRNA detection. This project would establish a fast and convenient miRNA detection method based on CRISPR, helping people to conveniently and efficiently detect miRNAs and contribute to myocardial infarction prevention.

4669	Hamburg	transFERRITIN - because we want to transfer it in!	Multiresistant pathogens are a rapidly emerging threat in our modern world. The World Health Organisation projects that by 2050, antibiotic resistances claim up to 10 million lives annually. A driving force behind antibiotic resistances is the overuse and inappropriate application of antibiotics. With transFERRITIN, we tackle this problem. We provide a solution with an effective and selective drug-delivery system based on human iron transport protein ferritin. With cell-penetrating peptides, that can transport proteins across almost any membrane, fused to every ferritin subunit, we can penetrate pathogens with ease. Additionally, we add highly specific nanobodies to the surface of our container, using click chemistry. Furthermore, all components can be exchanged. This allows a swift adaption to every patient’s needs. transFERRITIN could pave the way for a new generation of highly selective and effective drug-delivery systems.

4674	CCU-Taiwan	CTC-FAST: How we fight against lung cancer	Cancer claims nearly 10 million lives annually, constituting one-sixth of global deaths, with lung cancer being the leading cause, responsible for 1.8 million fatalities. This trend holds true in Taiwan. Cancer metastasis, the spread of cancer cells to other organs, is a major cause of death in lung cancer patients. Detecting these cells, known as Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), is crucial for early monitoring. Traditional antibody-based CTC detection methods have challenges related to storage and affordability. To address this, we've developed the user-friendly CTC-FAST device, capable of automatically labeling and detecting CTCs, while allowing reagents to be stored at room temperature. CTC-FAST makes CTC detection more accessible and affordable, improving postoperative follow-up and reducing cancer metastasis-related deaths.

4695	IFB-Gdansk	EDC-Seas: development of an enzymatic degradation system of dibutyl phthalate involving cellulosome-based immobilization.	Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) present in water have recently raised concerns about their negative impact on human and animal health. Phthalates, which belong to the EDCs, are widely used in industry as plasticizers, improving the mechanical properties of plastic materials. However, they can be released from materials to the environment and reach drinking water, where their concentrations often exceed the limits set by the WHO as safe. In response to the problem of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) pollution, we came up with the idea of a protein complex capable of efficient degradation of those pollutants. Based on literature, we designed a system consisting of enzymes fused to dockerin domains that enable binding to scaffoldin, which facilitates immobilization to cellulose. We expect that the resulting engineered proteins will make it possible to create a cell-free water filtration system which will degrade phthalates to easily biodegradable benzoic acid.

Abstract : Our primary objective was to create a robust pathogen detection system and transmit the information directly to researchers. After numerous iterations, with an initial focus on the West Nile virus sequence, Cas13a protein, and guide RNA, we proudly introduce the prototype of this cutting-edge system. This versatile model forms the basis for detecting a range of pathogens, including diseases like dengue and chikungunya. By harnessing the extraordinary specificity of Cas13a and guide RNA, our innovation facilitates precise identification of pathogenic nucleic acids within mosquito samples. This breakthrough has the potential to redefine pathogen detection, providing a potent tool for epidemiologists and researchers in their ongoing battle against mosquito-borne diseases. With further refinements and expansions, this technology holds the promise of significantly enhancing public health efforts. It enables early interventions and plays a pivotal role in epidemic prevention, representing a major stride toward a safer, healthier future.

4701	Aalto-Helsinki	PET-2-Protein: Revolutionizing Plastic Recycling and Protein Production	Our project aims to address two major global challenges: plastic pollution and food security. Our objective is to develop a proof-of-concept approach to convert PET plastic into a protein-rich biomass. The first phase includes enzymatic depolymerization of PET by the modified FAST-PETase and wild-type MHETase enzymes. We have produced PETase and attempted MHETase production via Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain cloning. Following, the resulting monomers of the depolymerization process, Terephthalic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG), are integrated within minimal media M9. This media is used to grow Rhodococcus opacus and Comamonas testosteroni bacterial strains. By utilising the monomers as their carbon source, the microorganisms produce a biomass which is further analysed, showing a significant content of proteins. In addition, we have designed new constructs to engineer other bacterial strains, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, to enhance the monomer assimilation pathways to improve their utilisation and the protein production.

4705	NJMU-China	Breaking the silence of the deep sea: One encounter at 52Hz frequency	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, and its incidence is increasing in recent years, which brings great burden to social development and medical security. It has been reported that due to genetic and environmental factors, the increased autoimmune antibodies in the brain of ASD patients will attack neurons, resulting in neuron death and disorder of behavior. Therefore, we decided to design small molecule drugs to block autoantibodies to alleviate the symptoms of autism. We screened ferrichrome and protoporphyrin IX that could bind to antibodies in intestinal microbiome small molecule metabolism library. Our experimental group designed the engineered bacteria to produce small molecule blockers through synthetic biological pathways. Our modeling group verified the high efficiency of its blocking antibodies through molecular docking. Our HP group provided safety, ethics and social significance support. We hope our research can provide potential therapeutic medicine for autistic children in the future.

4706	Duesseldorf	Fungilyzer: Engineering a Brighter Future for Agriculture	The Fungilyzer project offers an innovative solution to combat phosphate depletion in agricultural soils The project is inspired by the global challenges of phosphate depletion and eutrophication, driven by the finite nature of phosphate resources. It aims to revolutionize phosphate resource management and reshape agriculture by conserving the environment. Phosphorus is a vital plant macronutrient, comprising 0.2% of a plant's dry weight and playing a crucial role in plant growth. Modern agriculture heavily relies on phosphate-based fertilizers from finite reserves, leading to resource scarcity and phosphate runoff contributing to eutrophication. The Fungilyzer project addresses these issues by using genetic engineering to create a fungus, S. cerevisiae, with a sophisticated genetic switch. This switch senses phosphate deficiency and triggers apoptosis to release stored phosphate precisely when plants need it for growth.

4711	OUC-China	Turn waste cooking oil into MCAFs and their derivatives	2023 OUC-China igem team focuses on the green production of medium chain fatty acids and their derivatives.Firstly, MEL (Mannose-erythroitol) is produced by Moesziomyces aphidis XM01 using waste cooking oil as substrate, and a large number of medium chain fatty acids are obtained by hydrolyzing MEL. Due to the coexistence of different fatty acid pathways in XM01 strain, a large amount of MEL is formed and the accumulation of intracellular oil is caused. So the carbon flow is reconstructed to reduce the production of intracellular oil. In addition, two high-value medium chain fatty acid derivatives, alpha-olefin and 10-hydroxycapric acid, are produced by E.coli BL21. After communicating with relevant experts, it was found that benzopyrene in waste cooking oil was often difficult to degrade, so a red light system is designed to secrete corresponding enzymes to complete the degradation of this substance.

4722	BJEA-China	Nicotine Killers	Nicotine, a potent alkaloid found in plants of the nightshade family, is a crucial component of tobacco. As an addictive organic compound capable of creating dependency, repeated use of nicotine can trigger over 20 diseases, even leading to death. Quitting smoking is undoubtedly the most effective way to prolong life, but the intense addictive nature of nicotine and its withdrawal symptoms make quitting immensely challenging. Fortunately,researchers have discovered NicX in the human gut microbiota, a substance capable of degrading nicotine. Mouse experiments have shown that degrading nicotine can reduce withdrawal symptoms in these animals. This implies that using NicX to degrade nicotine could potentially serve as a viable method for smoking cessation. We aim to further enhance the nicotine degradation through 3 means:constructing a JI-NicX fusion protein, utilizing mutation techniques, and employing cell surface display system.

4723	H14Z-AP	Expressing a Tardigrade Protein to Prevent Taupathy in Drosophila	Tauopathy causes Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a common neurodegenerative disease with no cure. New therapeutic strategies are waiting to be discovered. Protein misfolding and cell death are two key features of AD. Scientists have identified a tardigrade protein called CAHS3 that can help protein folding and prevent cell death. In this study, we tested whether CAHS3 expression could attenuate tau toxicity in a fly AD model. We constructed a plasmid that can express V5-tagged CAHS3 protein in both culture cells and transgenic flies. We overexpressed CAHS3 alone or together with hTau in the fly eyes. Analyzing the fly eyes using SEM and our original mathematical model, we concluded that CAHS3 expression does not affect fly eye development. However, it does not provide significant improvement of the eye defects caused by hTau. In the future, we hope to test the effects of CAHS3 in other neurodegenerative disease models.

Our circuit makes use of the potassium ion efflux effect caused by cereulide on B. subtilis, our chassis, which activates the histidine kinase C in B. subtilis. This will result in the activation of the SinI promoter which will express a red signal when cereulide exceeds the safe level. Subsequently, if the sample consists of a safe level of cereulide, a green signal will be produced to indicate safety.

Recycling with a biological system not only could be cheaper than chemical methods, but such a system can repurpose PET, which takes hundreds of years to degrade, into a more environmentally friendly alternative that takes just a few weeks. As a result, we can reduce PET waste by transforming it into a bioplastic, which, after use, will be easier to degrade. Our project's main goals are: 1) Introducing parts that will allow for TPA (PET monomer) degradation 2) Improving PhaF, a PHB-binding protein that helps increase PHB production and accumulation and 3) Understanding the societal implications of our project by connecting with stakeholders and interacting with the community.

4729	Marburg	Expanding the range of transformable non-model plants through the development of synbio tools for Agrobacterium	The looming threat of climate change poses an immediate risk to the global food supply. This makes the development of reliable tools for plant synbio critical, if we are to successfully produce climate resistant crops. Despite their urgency, plant synbio projects are rather scarce in iGEM due to the exceptionally hard process of plant transformation. This year, the Marburg iGEM team tackled this problem by refining plant transformation protocols for non-model species, culminating in the first successful transformation of Bambara groundnut, a valuable legume for African countries. Furthermore, we thoroughly characterized novel genetic parts in Agrobacterium, and used them throughout several iterations of the DBTL cycle to create constructs that aim to enhance plant transformation efficiency and broaden the range of transformable plants. Ultimately, we hope to enable future teams to further extend the garden of plant projects in iGEM with new and diverse plant species.

Additionally, Toxoplasma gondii has an increased prevalence in cats, resulting in transmission to humans and other mammals due to contact with contaminated cat feces. However, there is no current vaccine or drug able to be set as a treatment for T. gondii. In order to address these issues, development of a vaccine to prevent transmission of T. gondii into the environment is necessary in the absence of an effective human model of a vaccine to prevent exposure. We deliver a bacterium within the feline’s food which will produce a phage acting as a carrier for a known T. gondii antigen.

4736	GeorgiaState-SWJTU	Bio-Barbie: Co-culturing C. reinhardtii and E. coli for PHB Production	As evidenced by climate change and plastic pollution, it has become increasingly necessary to develop an alternative to fossil-fuel based production, such as biologically-based production. Our project's aim is to create a polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production platform based on a co-culture between C. reinhardtii and E. coli. Such a co-culture has been shown to nearly double the growth of C. reinhardtii. Despite being in co-culture, PHB production in C. reinhardtii is limited by several conditions: 1) it is produced in small amounts, 2) it is only produced under stress, and 3) it is limited by acetyl-CoA availability. To counter these restraints, we propose modifying C. reinhardtii to express three genes to increase PHB production. In addition, we propose modifying E. coli to produce ethanol, a stress factor that will increase PHB in C. reinhardtii. Finally, we propose inactivating the ackA-pta pathway in E. coli to indirectly increase acetyl-CoA availability.

4737	BNUZH-China	FeFighterS - Engineered Bacteria Induce Ferroptosis in Tumor Cells	In this project, we have developed a novel strategy that utilizes attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 to induce ferroptosis in tumor cells. To further enhance the tumor targeting ability, we had genetically modified VNP20009 to express single chain antibody fragments on the outer membrane. Once the engineered bacteria reached the tumor tissue, it will secrete glucose oxidase into the tumor cells, mediating the occurrence of the Fenton reaction. Additionally, the engineered bacteria express shRNAs to silence the SLC7A11, leading to a reduction in glutathione levels and inactivation of GPX4. All above strategies facilitate lipid peroxidation and promote ferroptosis in the tumor cells. To ensure safety, we have implemented a toxin-antitoxin system to maintain plasmid stability and prevent horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, doxycycline administration induces self-destruction of the engineered bacteria at the end of the treatment.

4738	ASIJ-Tokyo	Project ESPHA: Exploring the Secretion of Polyhydroxyalkanoates	As global plastic production reaches a staggering 370 million tons in 2021 and the culture emphasizing hygiene and convenience in Japan continues to drive a prevalence of single-use plastics, emerging bioplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) provide a sustainable alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics. Project ESPHA attempts to explore various secretion methods in order to reduce downstream processing costs of PHA production. Existing research touches upon these systems but fails to fully explore the potential of secretion and remains poorly characterized in literature. Project ESPHA aims to collect comprehensive data and analysis for comparing various secretion systems from extensive literature review. We have compared standard type I and type II secretion systems involving HlyA and TorA secretion tags. In addition, we have characterized the novel use of vesicle nucleating peptides (VNps) for PHB secretion. Our project proposes a model for a less costly, environmentally friendly, and scalable future of PHA production.

4740	CNAS-Romania	Engineered Cyanobacteria For A Greener Future	Cyanobacteria are one of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Microorganisms capable of producing oxygen through photosynthesis, they live both in salt and freshwater. However, when their environment is polluted, they can cause algae blooms that are harmful to the ecosystem. Alcanivorax borkumensis is a type of bacteria that has the ability to break down alkanes, essentially decomposing petroleum into non-toxic components. A part that can give cyanobacteria the ability A. borkumensis has was engineered, with the hope that algae blooms can actually fight pollution. Three species of cyanobacteria were thoroughly researched through various experiments, and information that could benefit future scientists was gathered. The project started small, focusing on the local lake, and trying to adapt to the community’s needs. However, the team hopes that the proposed idea can help fight pollution on even larger scales, bringing a greener future one cyanobacteria at a time.

4741	RUBochum	Breaking ?-Lactams - Biosensors for Antibiotics	Multidrug-resistant bacteria are one of the major threats to humans nowadays. These pathogens can result from misuse, overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics and can lead to higher health care costs, longer disease progression and higher mortality. To prevent the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistances, antibiotics must be detected and deactivated. Since beta-lactam antibiotics are among the most used antibiotics, we aim to detect them. There are many different biosensors, but they require time-consuming and complex sample preparation and incur high costs. Therefore, we develop a low-cost and easy-to-use whole-cell biosensor. We chose Bacillus licheniformis as the host cell because it possesses a chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase gene induced by beta-lactam antibiotics. A green fluorescent protein is fused to the beta-lactamase for optical detection. The incorporation of the GFP into the chromosome is done by homologous recombination. The amplification of the gene fragments was successful but further work must be done.

4743	PTSH-Taiwan	Sarcotreat - An engineered live biotherapeutic product that treats sarcopenia	"Sarcopenia, a progressive muscle disorder, leads to muscle mass and strength loss with age. After 30, muscle decline is steady, reaching up to 50% by 70, resulting in disability and mortality. Globally, 50 million people suffer from sarcopenia, projected to rise to 500 million by 2050. No FDA-approved drugs exist; treatments rely on exercise, diet, and often side-effect-ridden hormone therapy. The sarcopenia treatment market, valued at $2.577 billion in 2020, is projected to hit $4.704 billion by 2030, growing at 6.1% annually. Our vision involves Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs), using genetically modified bacteria and yeast to produce muscle-enhancing compounds. These LBPs colonize the intestines, serving as probiotics and influencing metabolism. Recent research underscores the gut microbiota's role in muscle health, making the gut a promising target for sarcopenia therapy. Our LBP holds potential in this context, offering hope for a more effective approach to combating this debilitating condition."

4745	Lund	Reducing pharmaceutical pollution through microbial degradation	The detoxifying ecosystems project (DECO) aims to explore a possible cure for the pollution of ecosystems with diclofenac (DF), a common painkiller usually administered in gel form. This drug is present at toxic levels within many of the world's wastewater treatment facilities. The DECO-project is focused on the degradation of DF using E.coli and B.subtilis equipped with different laccase enzymes capable of chemically modifying the drug. The B.sub-native laccase CotA was rationally designed into three mutated versions (DeCotA I, II and III). Bacillus was equipped with two non-native laccases (Yak, Lcc1), and tested for DF degradation with different types of enzymatic assays . Laccase activity modifies DF into a less toxic form that degrades more easily. To do this effectively, a bacillus biofilm would likely have to be grown on a carrier material, equipped with a fail-safe mechanism and applied in wastewater treatment following an active sludge stage.

4751	McMaster-Canada	BACTRACK: AN INGESTIBLE BIOSENSOR FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF GUT METABOLITES RELATED TO MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER	Ambiguity in the DSM criteria of major depression disorder (MDD) exacerbates the challenges that clinicians and scientists face in its clinical assessment and research. Investigations of biomarkers related to MDD have highlighted the importance of the gut-brain axis in influencing mental health. An increase in Indole and a decrease in butyrate, tetrahydrofolate, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations has been noted in individuals with MDD, while tetrathionate is highly positively correlated with gut inflammation. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an E. coli multi-input ingestible biosensor for the characterization of these five metabolites implicated in MDD. An ingestible biosensor enables direct surveillance of the gut lumen, providing vital information on the microbiome which stool and serum samples cannot capture. Our proposed biosensor utilizes DNA writing with CRISPR based editors for molecular recording of signals, and pH detection as a means to establish temporal and spatial specificity in the gut.

4754	Lethbridge	Engineering a Direct Detection Assay for Clubroot Pathogen in Canola Soil and Roots	Clubroot, caused by the pathogenic soil-borne protist Plasmodiophora brassicae, poses a significant threat to Brassicae crops worldwide. Characterized by the development of abnormal growths or galls on plant roots, clubroot poses a serious risk to our local economy by depriving nutrients and inducing plant death in canola, our most profitable crop in Alberta. Currently, farmers outsource detection to off-site laboratories which utilize PCR amplification, a process that is costly and time-consuming. Instead, we are developing a rapid and direct ELISA testing system that utilizes rationally designed, model-based chimeric proteins fused with fluorescent probes (eGFP) that bind to P. brassicae-specific protein targets, Pro1 and PbEL04. We ultimately aim to develop a user-friendly rapid detection system, which can accurately confirm Clubroot within hours, indicating the presence of P. brassicae. Implementing our detection system would provide farmers with a rapid and affordable detection method, enabling quicker execution of clubroot mitigation strategies.

The hydroxylated product (6?-OH DCA) was developed to improve the solubility and pharmaceutic properties of DCA for further applications. Herein, a combinatorial strategy was applied to construct a powerful Cytochrome P450 biocatalyst (CYP107D1, Olep) to convert DCA to 6?-OH DCA. Firstly, the weak expression of OleP was significantly improved using pRSFDuet-1 plasmid in E. coli C41(DE3) strain. Next, the supply of heme was enhanced by the moderate overexpression of crucial genes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. In addition, a new biosensor was developed to select the appropriate redox partner. Furthermore, a cost-effective whole-cell catalytic system was constructed, resulting in the highest reported conversion rate of DCA to 6?-OH DCA (from 4.8% to 99.1%). The combinatorial strategies applied in this study provide an efficient method to synthesize high value-added hydroxylated compounds by P450s.

Apart from common treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and checkpoint inhibitors, Osimertinib, as the first-line targeted therapy for NSCLC patients with an EGFR mutation, can develop acquired drug resistance, thus affecting its long-term efficacy. Our team has therefore established an innovative approach that involves developing a cyclic peptide on the bispecific antibody which simultaneously binds EGFR and c-MET to overcome the Osimertinib resistance, and to inhibit tumour cell proliferation.

Therefore, we have developed a new testing system with double enzymes, DSN and Cas12a, combined with one circular probe that consists of anti-sense DNA sequence for target microRNA and specific sgRNA, to catch the trace microRNA in the plasma and then convert target microRNA quantities into visible signals by colloidal gold particles for early MetS diagnosis. With linear and exponential amplification advances, our system could successfully detect the disease-related microRNA in plasma. After reading the results by APP, our system could provide the diagnosis report about MetS, even telemedicine.

4780	ANU-Australia	A modular bioaccumulation platform for heavy-metal bioremediation	In our project, we engineer heavy-metal binding proteins (MBPs) localised to encapsulin-nanocompartments delivered by bacteriophages into bacteria to capture and sequester toxic arsenic compounds. Our vision is to have engineered phages cause bacteria to produce the necessary bioremediation tools and clean up any heavy metal waste, not just arsenic. This strategy will be cost-effective, non-toxic and non-invasive. We successfully cloned and expressed encapsulins and novel metal binding proteins designed using machine learning methods. We also identified problems with the GC content of proteins designed using RFdiffusion, a new protein design program. Furthermore we cloned several guide RNAs into multiple phages and are beginning to test the delivery of our binding protein sequences into these phages. In the future we plan to test the binding and kinetics of our metal binding proteins, test the delivery of our sequences into phages and then expression in the phage target bacteria.

4781	IISER-Kolkata	Xanthacinator - Detection and Targeted Elimination of Xanthomonas, causal agent of Bacterial Blight of rice	India is one of the largest producers as well as consumers of rice and yet, our farmers are plagued by a host of diseases that cause immense crop loss every year. Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes severe epidemic in rice fields across the country, and destroys upto 75% of rice crop in some cases. The absence of detection kits in the market only leads to confusion and worsens the situation. Annual losses caused by bacterial blight is estimated at U.S. $3.6 billion in India alone. Existing solutions like chemical pesticides and antibiotics have not proved very effective, and after much research, we came up with a two fold solution to this problem. Xanthacinator comprises an easy-to-use colorimetric detection kit that farmers can use to detect Xanthomonas infection, and a novel outer membrane mediated delivery of CRISPR machinery for targeted killing of Xanthomonas.

Current challenges in onco-therapy include targeting, specificity, and side effects. With that in mind, we are focused on applying synthetic biology to develop a live bacteria-based antitumor therapeutic vaccine delivered in situ to solid carcinomas by a thermosensitive hydrogel. We will use a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli BL21 (DE3) to produce a native to the bacteria pore-forming toxin, Colicin E1, expressed in response to a high lactate presence in the tumor microenvironment. To prevent a harsh immune reaction, we encapsulate bacteria into a chitosan-based thermosensitive and biodegradable hydrogel, solidifying in situ upon injection. As a result of the project, a smart, localized, and controlled therapeutic vaccine will be developed to be injected once and ensure sustainable drug release for a determined period.

4788	LZU-CHINA	Intelligent cholesterol management system	High-fat diets in the modern world have led to a significant impact on cardiovascular health. Conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and various cardiovascular diseases resulting from excessive cholesterol intake are of great concern. Current clinical treatments primarily rely on medication to control cholesterol levels, but they come with associated side effects, creating new health risks. To address these issues, LZU-CHINA has developed a probiotic-based cholesterol-regulating system, using an oleic acid inducer as the promoter module. This system introduces three types of genes: IsmA, BCoAT, and BSH, to directly convert cholesterol, influence cholesterol absorption, and promote bile acid excretion. By combining direct and indirect pathways, the system improves the efficiency of cholesterol regulation. Appropriate thresholds of oleic acid concentration activate the expression of these genes. LZU-CHINA aims to achieve precise regulation of cholesterol levels under high-fat diets, thereby preventing hypercholesterolemia and related cardiovascular diseases.

4790	NNU-CHINA	Machine learning-aided engineering of two-enzyme system for PET depolymerization	One of the grand challenges of the 21st century is to solve the environmental problem caused by plastic waste. In 2016, researchers identified PETase that can depolymerize PET into monomers. However, PETase was limited by temperature ranges. To overcome this challenge, we reconstructed ancestral sequences of PETase by employing the profile-HMM algorithm. To further enhance the thermostability and catalytic efficiency of ASR-PETase, we used machine learning algorithms to identify stabilizing variants. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to demonstrate the driving force behind the increased degradation capacity. Subsequently, we constructed a two-enzyme system to produce homogeneous TPA to achieve closed-loop recycling of PET. Our project is committed to educating the public about the current situation and solutions to plastic pollution and to providing a green and sustainable solution strategy for PET degradation.

Currently, commercial manufacture of 1,5-PDO entirely relies on petroleum feedstock, which is constrained by the limited accessible C5 petroleum feedstocks. In our work, we developed a cell factory to produce 1,5-PDO from glucose in Escherichia coli through the synthetic biology tools. Firstly, an artificial 1,5-PDO biosynthetic pathway was designed and assembled in E. coli. Subsequently, we improved strain production ability by optimizing gene expression plasmid and knocking out the genes of branched pathways. Finally, we further optimized pathway by engineering limiting enzyme of MmCAR through the mutation and protein scaffold assembly strategies. After fermentation of 80 h, the 1,5-PDO production was reached to 48 mM (5.0 g/L). Our work provided insights for the biological production of 1,5-PDO from renewable carbon source.

We utilised a recombinant E. coli nitrite reductase enzyme and improved its activity and stability through rational design. In addition, we have optimised the fermentation process for large-scale production of the enzyme preparation. The enzyme immobilised on a gold nano-electrode converts the nitrite concentration into an electrical signal. By measuring the current generated by the electrode, the sample to be tested can be accurately detected. An electronic switch will also be designed to regulate the delivery of nitrite reductase to the sample. In this way, when the current signal exceeds a preset threshold, the switch triggers the delivery of nitrite reductase, thus enabling the harmless treatment of nitrite. The device is characterised by low cost, simple operation and portability, making it suitable for home use, food production and sewage treatment.

4804	Bioplus-China	“Eating plastic spider silk”- Improving plastic degradation with PETase-Spider Silk fusion protein	Plastic waste poses a serious challenge to the ecological environment. Enzymatic degradation offers one potentially green way to achieve the recycling and utilization of plastic waste. Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced synthetic polymers, making up 12% of global solid waste. Enhancing the “capture and gathering” of plastics is crucial for increasing the hydrolysis efficiency of PET hydrolase degradation. Due to the characteristics of spider silk protein, this protein complex is expected to have toughness and stickiness, which facilitates the binding of plastic. In this study, we successfully constructed the prokaryotic expression system of PETase (PET-digesting enzyme) and R (a repetitive region of pyriform silk gene PySp1) fusion protein. Our results show that PETase-R recombinant proteins significantly improve the degradation efficiency of PET plastic.

IRIS is a novel therapeutic approach merging Photodynamic Therapy and Bacterial Mediated Tumor Therapy, two promising methods employed in the battle against cancer. By utilizing E.coli, a facultative anaerobic bacteria species, we specifically target the nutrient-rich hypoxic regions of solid tumors and express the necessary genes for an efficient therapy. Overexpression of four genes from the hem family leads to the accumulation of 5-ALA, a precursor for the photosensitizer PpIX. Subsequently, rhtA, an exporter also expressed by IRIS, transports 5-ALA into cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of PpIX. The PS molecule reacts with oxygen, generated by human catalase even in hypoxia, and 410nm light, generated by the interaction of Rluc8 and methoxy-e-coelenterazine. This dynamic interaction results in ROS production, achieving cancer cell cytotoxicity.

4810	Athens	ScentiPD	The goal of our project is the creation of a portable diagnostic kit for the detection and quantification of specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from skin sebum. Those compounds have been associated with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), with evidence pointing to their change in concentration occurring long before the evident onset of the disease. The alternative way to measure these compounds would be a GC/MS machine, with obvious drawbacks. Our proposed way for this detection is using the M13 Bacteriophage as a colorimetric biosensor. This technique utilizes the phage’s capsid proteins, which can obtain affinity for the target compounds by genetic engineering. After the VOC-protein binding has occurred, the phages “swell”, changing the way they interact with light, and finally giving off a different color. This color is structural (not dependent on dyes) and non-iridescent (not affected by the viewing angle), and can then be captured and quantified by a camera.

To address this problem, we developed two biosensing systems with DNA repairing mechanisms: (1) Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems with ATRIP and RPA1 in human cells, and (2) a RecA-eGFP reporting system in E.coli. We can detect DNA damage by analyzing the binding of ATRIP-EGFP and RPA1-mCherry using FRET. Additionally, we built two RecA promoters with different RBS and tested them with various carcinogens using plate readers and cell imaging. With these systems, we can screen substances for their potential carcinogenic properties in a cost-effective manner, thereby, helping cancer prevention.

4815	NJU-China	Pymaker: AI modified yeast promoter	Data is the biggest obstacle in the application of artificial intelligence. For biotechnology, acquiring data means a significant investment of manpower, time, and financial resources. In reality, often only tens of thousands of data points are accessible, while high-performance AI requires data on a scale of at least a million. To cross over the gap of data requirement, we innovatively employed the paradigm of 'pre-train + fine-tuning', and aimed at the key component of synthetic biology—promoters. Our AI model shows high ability in learning the inherent features of promoter sequences based on limited experimental data. Meanwhile, our AI model can successfully generate promoter sequences with specific expression rates, making highly efficient optimization to yeast promoters. Furthermore, our AI model proves that our paradigm of transfer learning has strong scalability and can be successfully expended to almost every aspect of synthetic biology, present a realistic answer for using AI in biology.

4816	Bonn-Rheinbach	NitraNix: Mitigating Nitrate Pollution through Synthetic Biology	"Nitrate pollution, driven by excessive fertilizer use, poses significant health and environmental risks, particularly in developed countries like Germany. This study explores the development of a novel approach to combat nitrate pollution in groundwater. Current methods, including ""Wasser Bildung"" a dilution technique and chemical seequestration of nitrate, have limitations in terms of cost and efficiency. The proposed solution leverages synthetic biology to transform nitrate through a cell-free denitrifying cycle using enzymes found in native denitrifying bacteria. By modifying key cytochromes in the pathway, the goal is to create a cost-effective biocatalytic process. With the rising challenges of population growth and urbanization, this project holds promise in addressing nitrate pollution and its implications for human health and the environment."

4817	SCU-China	SRBioQuencher	Hydrogen sulfide(H2S) is a harmful gas in urban sewers, due to its toxicity, pungent odor, and flammability. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), the main source of H2S in sewer, tend to resist the current chemical treatment once the biofilm formed. Here, we designed a predator, SRBioQuencher to kill SRB, thereby reducing the high H2S concentrations in sewers efficiently and safely. Cocktail therapy was applied by equipping SRBioQuencher with the ability to eliminate SRB biofilms by introduced glycosidases to degrade their main skeletons, inhibit the reformation of SRB biofilm by degrading the quorum sensing signal molecules, and kill SRB by the expressed antimicrobial peptides. Besides, H2S produced by SRBioQuencher was oxidized, the number of SRBioQuenchers was regulated efficiently and safely by a suicide system induced by SRB quorum sensing molecules. Our project provides a comprehensive and safe biological control strategy for prevention and control of harmful bacteria prone to the biofilm formation.

4818	INSAENSLyon1	SUPERBUGBUSTER, a removal of antibiotic resistance	"Called the ""silent"" pandemic, antibiotic resistance is one of the most important issues that contemporary medicine faces today. Causing millions of deaths per year all over the world, the number keeps rising to a predicted 10 million deaths in 2050. It is mainly due to our over-consumptions through the years. But for now, no technological solution exists, and no new antibiotics have yet been discovered. To avoid this disaster, the INSA-ENS-Lyon1 team created SuperBugBuster, a project and a tool capable of removing resistance from bacteria. Based on two different approaches: CRISPR-cas9 and Bac-PROTAC systems, it permits an innactivation of a targeted resistant gene and the degradation of the associated proteins. The project construction also includes creating software to design CRISPR-cas9 RNA guide genes and important work on human practices and education of society, which is the core and the beginning of the issue of antibiotic resistance."

Billions of people from poverty-stricken regions suffer from Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), caused by pathogens found in their communities. At HelmiGuard, we have created an oral vaccine to help forge a path to hope for two of the deadliest NTDs: echinococcosis & cysticercosis. Using adeno-associate virus phage (AAVP) technology - a filamentous bacteriophage modified to interact with human cells - we hope to target and destruct the larvae in the small intestine, before they can grow and spread. Specifically, we plan to utilize an RGD-4C peptide motif to interact with alpha integrin receptors found on dendritic cells within the Peyer's Patches. By doing so, we are not only improving patient outcomes, but also working to break the cycle of hopelessness & poverty that these diseases create.

4820	NYU-New-York	At-home Iron Level Detection Using Salivary Ferritin	The problem of iron deficiency anemia affects close to 25% of the global population and most heavily those of lower socioeconomic status (StatPearls). Currently, iron levels are most commonly detected by labs testing blood samples from patients which can be expensive and time consuming. We’re creating a non-invasive method to measure iron levels by detecting salivary ferritin, a protein that stores iron, using a peptide or DNA aptamer. We plan to create an electronic, inexpensive biosensor in which the aptamer detects and binds to ferritin in saliva, emitting a fluorescent signal proportional to the concentration of the ferritin analyte. This signal is then read by an Arduino sensor and prepared to be displayed on a user interpretation system that can generate understandable iron level results. We found both aptamers through extensive literature review and computational docking. We’re now testing both aptamers through direct biotin-streptavidin ELISA.

4823	HKSSC	E. coli biosensor for detection and cleaving of autoinducer among Burkholderia pseudomallei, for reducing virulence	Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei containing biofilm in contaminated area, affecting people in Hong Kong with 34 cases including 7 deaths. Since it’s a multi-drug resistant, the conventional therapy for Melioidosis has proven futile and the clinical therapy for Melioidosis last for 20 days. Therefore, to combat this issue, an effective way to prevent the spread of B. pseudomallei is urgent. Our team has designed an engineered biosensor model to counter measure the issue. The biosensor will cleave the AHL molecules until the disruption of biofilm. Consequently the virulence of the bacterium will be reduced. When there is no more AHL molecules, the biosensor will carry out its apoptosis. We are targeting not only an easy way to detect pathogens, but also countering the contamination effectively.

4824	Bioplus-Shanghai	Chinese herbal medicine meets synthetic biology——Biosynthesis of UGT72B2 from Isatis indigotica	War, famine and plague are the three major challenges facing humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic in recent years has made people actually aware of the immense threat posed by this modern plague. Modern pharmacology and clinical practice have demonstrated the significant antiviral properties of various plants. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize synthetic biology to identify and synthesize antiviral compounds found in plants on an industrial scale for drug development. In this study, we employed pre-transcriptomic data to screen and clone the antiviral-related genes UGT72B2 in I. indigotica. Subsequently, we constructed a prokaryotic expression vector to characterize the function of UGT72B2 through in vitro enzymatic reaction. The enzymatic assay revealed that UGT72B2 catalyzes the production of glycosides from four types of lignans, namely lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol, and matairesinol. Our research provides a foundation for the efficient heterologous synthesis of lignans or lignan-derivative glycosides, which are key antiviral components of I. indigotica.

In our project, we use genetic engineering technique to create a complex of Beta-2-transferrin and mCherry to develop the Beta-2-transferrin detection kit. Because of Beta-2-transferrin's high specificity, it would be a detection marker for accurately confirming the presence of CSF. In the future, our project could be a convenient, accurate, fast, and user-friendly kit to help people quickly test for CSF rhinorrhea as a timly warning.

4849	Edinburgh	Pollinator-friendly Biophotovoltaic Solar Panel	Our interdisciplinary project tackles climate change and rising energy demands, revolutionizing renewable energy with biophotovoltaics (BPVs). Facing a 32% surge in energy demand by 2040, a shift to sustainable technologies is imperative. Solar energy, though promising, grapples with challenges in silicon-based panel manufacturing. BPVs, while promising, suffer from low conversion efficiencies. Focused on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we enhance photosynthetic output with the MTR complex, and salt tolerance. Beyond energy, we repurpose BPV waste into artificial pollen for pollinator-friendly panels, aligning with circular economy principles by enriching essential amino acids, histidine, and lysine in our cyanobacteria waste. Biosafety is paramount, ensured by a zinc-inducible kill switch. Our project strides towards a sustainable energy future, marrying efficient BPVs, circular economy principles, and responsible deployment, addressing climate challenges within a concise framework.

4850	NUS-Singapore	Optimised Technique For swiTch Engineering and Ranking (OTTER)	RNA switches are robust and versatile tools in various fields including bioproduction, drug delivery, and disease detection. However, the difficulty in designing the switches hinders its wide applications. A key reason that makes the design process challenging is that the interaction between RNAs are hardly predictable using currently models/tools. Furthermore, there lacks available quality RNA data for developing the models. In our project, we sought to develop OTTER, a tool that is designed to predict effectiveness of RNA switches and develop a new high throughput workflow (SIGNAL) and novel experimentally validated bioparts to facilitate the generation of large RNA library and data. To this end, we built new bioparts and focus on developing deep learning to model RNA-RNA interactions coupled with generative model to suggest RNA switch designs for OTTER. We use RNA switch systems such as STARs and Toehold as our model system.

4852	GEMS-Taiwan	Cure-All Reef: An all-inclusive biofilm-based probiotic delivery system for sustainable coral conservation.	Coral reefs are vital for marine ecosystems and economies, but climate change is causing rapid decline through coral bleaching and disease outbreaks. Probiotics aids corals in fighting environmental stress, but efficient delivery methods aren't available. Cure-all Reefs aims to utilize a coral spray with a unique biofilm-based mechanism for better probiotic adhesion, increasing absorption. We integrated two quorum-sensing mechanisms to regulate biofilm growth and minimize bacteria dispersion beyond the application site. Furthermore, we've developed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for precise delivery. An extensive entrepreneurship plan combines the coral spray and AUV together and outlines a service that incentivizes corporations to increase their blue carbon credit investments, which we hope will lead to increased ocean conservation efforts . Our novel probiotic delivery system and all-inclusive service not only aim to address the lack of existing delivery methods, but also strive for a bluer and more sustainable future.

4858	Michigan	SNP-IT: A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Detection Platform to Inform Antiplatelet Pharmacotherapy	Antiplatelet medications are a common treatment for patients after experiencing thrombotic events, such as venous thromboembolism or some forms of stroke. Recently, a genetic variant— the rs773902 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)—was identified that may reduce efficacy of a standard-of-care antiplatelet regimen, aspirin and clopidogrel. This SNP is present in a diverse range of individuals, but is especially prevalent in those of African descent. With alternative medications available that maintain their efficacy in the presence of this SNP, our team sought to develop a point-of-care diagnostic test to detect the rs773902. We propose that physicians use this test to evaluate SNP presence in their patient and make more informed, personalized antiplatelet prescription decisions. Our team employed loop-mediated isothermal amplification and machine learning-generated fluorescent probes to design and make progress towards demonstrating efficacy of our SNP detection platform.

A primary challenge lies in degrading PFAS, given the highly stable carbon-fluorine bonds present in their structure. The project aims to enhance the enzymatic activity of dehalogenases isolated from Delfia acidovorans for the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Utilizing a fluoride-sensitive riboswitch linked to the expression of green fluorescent protein, we can effectively measure enzymatic activity and thus assess the enzymatic activity of the optimized dehalogenases. Through computational modeling, we have predicted the protein structures and optimized binding pockets for PFOA and other PFAS. These predictions were compared to variants from a dehalogenase mutant library generated using error-prone PCR. Collaboration with local water treatment facilities has tailored our project to real-life applications, paving the way for potential advancements in PFAS bioremediation strategies.

4880	BASIS-China	CyanoScent	Aromatherapy can serve as a complementary therapy to alleviate stress. However, traditional methods of producing aromatic substances, such as terpenes, are often both complex and environmentally damaging. Therefore, we endeavored to discover a synthetic approach to produce these aroma substances, replacing traditional processes and making them directly usable in daily life. We finally decided to use cyanobacteria as a chassis. Through photosynthesis, our engineering cyanobacteria can utilize carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce these terpenes. Following we are committed to developing our scent-producing cyanobacteria into bioreactors that can meet people's daily needs. We have designed several bioreactors to support the growth and scent production of cyanobacteria. Additionally, we have incorporated suicide switches within the cyanobacteria to prevent biohazards associated with the engineered organisms.

4884	OKstate	CH4NGERS: A Novel Approach to Methane Mitigation	In the face of climate change, one of the most pressing challenges of our time, it is imperative that we address the issue of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas with approximately 25 times the heat-trapping capacity of CO2. Recognizing the urgent need for a more effective solution, our iGEM team is passionately committed to developing an innovative approach that will substantially reduce methane emissions from dairy digesters. Our focus lies in adapting the plasmid sequence for Methane Monooxygenase (MMO), an enzyme that is able to convert methane into methanol, to suit the specific characteristics of E. coli, our chosen host organism. Optimizing the plasmid sequence is crucial to achieve high-level expression of MMO in E. coli. By tailoring the plasmid to the unique features of E. coli, we aim to maximize protein yield and ensure efficient conversion of methane to methanol.

Butyl butyrate’s low viscosity and low carbon emission make it a biofuel with a high potential of alleviating the above problems. We genetically engineered C. tyrobutyricum to enable efficient and large-scale synthesis of butyl butyrate. We optimize metabolic pathways through three strategies to further reinforce the synthesis of butyrate and butanol, including precursor accumulation, inhibition of byproducts, and increasing mass transfer efficiency as well as promoter engineering. The results showed that yields of butyl butyrate can be improved to varying degrees, which indicated that it is a promising way to improve the biosynthesis efficiency of butyl butyrate.

4886	Nanjing-BioX	"""Carbon Fast"": Synthetic non-oxidative glycolytic pathway for complete carbon conversion"	Global warming, rising sea levels, and continued environmental degradation are all linked to carbon emissions. In China, microbial carbon emissions account for 7% of the total, and most of the carbon emissions generated by microorganisms come from sugar degradation. Carbon sequestration is conducive to reducing carbon emissions. This project attempts to introduce a highly active phosphoketolase (F/Xpk) gene into the heterotrophic C. tyrobutyricum, to construct an artificial NOG pathway with high metabolic flux. Compared with the native EMP pathway, this alternative pathway metabolizes glucose into acetyl CoA without carbon loss. We further tried to improve the F/Xpk expression by promoter engineering and ASR. Besides, we found that this engineered strain has a higher ability to utilize cheaper carbon sources. The approach used in this project can be further adapted to a variety of strains with similar metabolic carbon emission issues, thereby contributing to the reduction of global carbon emissions.

Firstly, sgRNA oligos targeting the IbGBSSI gene was designed and annealed, and was inserted into the plasmid psgR-Cas9-At to construct the backbone vector, which was combined with the binary vector pCAMBIA1301s to obtain the expression vector. This knockout construct was transformed later into embryogenic calli of sweet potato and then IbGBSSI-deficient mutants were received after further culturing and screening. After detections of the storage root starch of the mutants, it showed that the total starch content in the storage roots of the mutants was hardly changed, but the proportion of amylose was significantly reduced to between 0.5% and 0.8% while it was 23.33% of the wild-type. It indicated that high-purity amylopectin can be produced by these engineered sweet potato lines and used for performance starch-based biodegradable plastic production.

Classified as a group-one carcinogen by the International Agency for Cancer, cadmium contamination remains a critical issue. It accumulates in soil and water, impacting food supplies. Our project proposes a Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP) that attaches to the small intestine's mucus lining, binding cadmium and facilitating natural elimination. Initially using Escherichia coli as a proof-of-concept, we aim to progress to gut-native bacteria like Lactobacillus. Our approach involves two induced proteins: a mucus-binding protein (SpaC), only induced in culture, and a cadmium-binding protein (EC20). To ensure safety, we administer zinc and iron concurrently to prevent mineral depletion and employ a double gene knockout strategy to prevent Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). This LBP offers a promising solution to mitigate global cadmium contamination, safeguarding human health.

The main culprits behind this pollution are textile industries and car workshops, discharging hazardous organometallic compounds. Extensive research has revealed a critical flaw in current bioremediation systems: their inability to effectively eliminate toxic organometallic compounds, known to be more harmful than other metal forms. In response, we present an innovative solution called Lichenysin—a biosurfactant that forms micelles, effectively trapping and facilitating the effortless removal of these compounds. Through the implementation of synthetic biology, our goal is to engineer a modified version of E. coli capable of producing Lichenysin. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing bioremediation systems but also mitigates concerns regarding potential pathogenicity associated with the native strain.

Our team developed six bacterial expression vectors with PETase and six dual expression plasmids containing PETase and MHETase enzymes for optimal PET degradation using Pseudomonas putida, targeting scalability in PET recycling plants. Due to time constraints, we focused on comparing the mutant form of BBa_J435500_W159H_S238F enzyme with wildtype PETase, using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) as a PET analog. Under conditions of 2500 nanomolar pNPB, pH 9.0, and 30°C, the modified PETase's activity exceeded the wildtype's by seven-fold. This highlights the potential of BBa_J435500_W159H_S238F for developing PET recycling strategies.

4917	Estonia-TUIT	BeeYeast: Yeast Engineering to Fight Bee Viral Infections	Honey bees play a crucial role as pollinators that is essential for preserving biodiversity. They also yield valuable products such as honey and beeswax, integral to human livelihoods. Unfortunately, honey bee populations are globally declining, influenced by factors like pathogens, climate shifts, and excessive pesticide use. Among these challenges, the Deformed wing virus (DWV), primarily transmitted by mites, is particularly widespread and detrimental, causing the death of millions of bees annually. The Estonia-TUIT team aims to suppress viral protein expression within bee cells by inducing RNA interference response. Our strategy involves genetically modified yeast cells producing short hairpin RNAs, which inhibit DWV gene expression. To deliver these shRNAs into bee cells, we intend to either feed our modified yeast to bees or directly inject shRNA-containing extracts into honeycombs. This approach aims to boost the bee's inherent RNA interference immune response, protecting them from the virus's harmful effects.

4919	CU-Boulder	Milking the New Whey	Bovine milk production significantly contributes to global warming, largely due to cow methane production. This research begins to solve this problem by using the more sustainable organism, soybeans, to generate a genetically equivalent form of whey protein found in bovine milk. Soybean fields use less land, energy, and produce fewer greenhouse gasses than milk farms, making them more sustainable for milk production. This research uses synthetic biology techniques to bioengineer the whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin in soybeans. This is done by engineering a DNA plasmid containing the alpha-lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin coding region, a promoter and terminator specific to soybeans, and a GUS reporter gene. This plasmid is then transformed into Agrobacterium which will naturally insert the synthetic plasmid into a soybean seed. The transfected soybean seed will then have the machinery to produce whey proteins. Producing whey proteins in soybeans is the first step to sustainably produce bovine milk.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternatives to chemical fertilizers. Studies have shown that hydrogen-rich water has a positive effect on plant growth and is expected to act as a potential ""hydrogen fertilizer"" to reduce fertilizer use.We designed an innovative synthetic biology method for producing hydrogen-rich water. Using methanol and NAD+ as substrate, hydrogen-rich water was prepared by cascade catalytic reaction of 4 enzymes. In addition,we designed a protein scaffold to assemble the four enzymes into an artificial multi-enzyme complex, which promoted the substrate channel effect and improved the preparation efficiency of hydrogen-rich water by 2.58 times."

4930	FAU-Erlangen	GLOW.coli - with Bacteria against IBDs	The importance of gut health has gained significant recognition in recent years. Research has shown that the composition of the gut microbiome, can help in the prevention or exasperation of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). New studies have specifically linked IBD development to gut dysbiosis, a changed gut microbiome composition associated with a reduction in beneficial bacteria and associated compounds. A crucial component of a healthy gut microbiome are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Alterations in SCFA ratios have been directly associated with IBDs. Our goal is to develop an early detection system that would enable people to check for patterns of dysbiosis linked to IBDs in order to discover autoimmune inflammation early. This would allow for prompt intervention and prevent inflammatory damage to the gut which leads to the severe quality of life reduction that many patients report.

4931	IIT-Madras	Synthopedia	The absence of many genetic and regulatory libraries in unconventional chassis makes building genetic circuits and assemblies extremely difficult. There is an emerging need to explore new chassis which may be naturally adapted to unique traits or metabolic pathways. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is one such ‘Generally Regarded As Safe’ (GRAS) organism that produces a range of products. Since the ability to fine-tune gene expression forms a cornerstone for the design and operation of genetic circuits, our project intends to construct and test a library of synthetic 5’ Untranslated Regions (UTR) containing Ribosome binding sites (RBS) in L. lactis. Creating a well-characterized library of RBS sequences would enable the rational engineering of this bacterium towards increased yield of products. We have also built Synthopedia, a user-friendly web tool based on a machine-learning model that features tools for RBS Rate Prediction and Optimization.

PQQ, a highly valuable antioxidant, has been shown in previous research to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolic rate, and memory. However, feeding such an expensive compound to insects is impractical. In this iGEM project, we have introduced PQQ biosynthetic pathway into Bacillus subtilis natto. We then fed the supernatant to our model honeybees, Apis mellifera. In brief, we used electroporation to transform the plasmid and treated the bees with the supernatant. For the bees, we adopted a buffet-style feeding approach on the first day with PQQ, followed by continuous monitoring of the bees subsequently. The results revealed that the effects of PQQ on bees disappeared by the third day post-feeding but could be restored through refeeding. Furthermore, the experiments showed that PQQ significantly improved the flight capabilities and memory of the bees.

Yeast cell factory has been widely applied in practical production. However, multiple stress challenges(such as high temperature and extreme pH environments) during the fermentation process significantly reduce its availability. Enhancing its tolerance can substantially reduce production costs and energy consumption, expanding the application scope of yeast cell factories. Polyamines, a class of widely distributed organic compounds derived from primary metabolic pathways, are associated with many stress-related phenotypes. Inspired by the relationship between polyamines and stress tolerance in plants and extremophiles, in YEAST PATRONUS, we utilized polyamine metabolism to construct a thermotolerant yeast cell factory. This involved various methods, including exogenous addition, endogenous expression, and exogenous expression, to validate our hypothesis. We achieved the production of various polyamines and conducted a preliminary evaluation of their thermo-tolerance capabilities.

4940	iZJU-China	Eco-Art: A solution for pungent odors degradation in oil painting based on engineering bacteria.	Turpentine is a commonly used thinner in oil painting, which can modify the viscosity of oil painting pigments. However, its pungent odors, mainly caused by alpha-pinene, poses a threat to the health of oil painting practitioners. Our project hopes to construct engineering bacteria to degrade alpha-pinene, the main component of turpentine. The degradation process includes two parts: an improved alpha-pinene oxidation system and an alpha-pinene oxide lyses system. Firstly, exogenous alpha-pinene monooxygenase was introduced into E. coli to facilitate the oxidation of alpha-pinene into alpha-pinene oxidate. Then, alpha-pinene oxidate can be converted into isonovalal by E. coli introduced with alpha-pinene oxide lyase. We intend to apply our engineering bacteria to the real world. Therefore, a product in the form of biological air purifier was designed. We hope that our engineering bacteria can solve the problem of turpentine's pungent odors and provide an environmentally friendly future for oil painting.

This project develops a novel biotherapeutic to delay AD onset by engineering the probiotic bacterium Clostridium butyricum to produce the neuroprotective metabolite butyrate. Using a two-plasmid CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system delivered via bacterial spores to the gut, C. butyricum is optimized to synthesize and secrete elevated butyrate. Through the gut-brain axis, butyrate confers neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain. Quantum Machine learning is used to identify the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage to administer the synthetic biotic and classify possible drug targets. For human practices, we authored a neuroethical report examining the ethics and responsibility of genetic Engineering and our project. Upon surveying the relevant stakeholders, we created a caregiver resource app that integrates AD patient information and routines.

4944	Calgary	CholesterLock	iGEM Calgary presents CholesterLock, a novel proof of concept for an alternative high cholesterol medication. It employs synthetic biology to develop a fusion protein that targets NPC1L1, a lipid transporter protein found in the lining of the small intestines. NPC1L1 is involved in absorption of both cholesterol, and saturated fats which are used in the downstream synthesis of cholesterol. Our fusion protein consists of an Immunoglobulin G fragment, a linker, and a hedgehog family protein fragment bound to cholesterol, which is meant to inhibit NPC1L1 by blocking the site of cholesterol intake, preventing absorption. Side effects of many medications arise when the medication ends up in unintended locations, that is why CholesterLock is designed to be completely contained to the gastrointestinal tract. This innovative approach holds potential to be a highly specific, cost-effective, and low side-effect alternative to traditional medication.

The red color is controlled by the yeaR promoter, which enables the expression of mScarlet, and the green color is controlled by the amount of mScarlet produced, other polycistronic-arranged repressors and Lon protease. When exposed to nitrate, the yeaR promoter is activated to form the repressor and Lon protease along with mScarlet, and the expression of mVenus is suppressed by the repressor. The mVenus quickly decomposes by the Lon protease, changing the color of the bead into red. The sensor contains the beads that are made by modified E. coli bacteria having chromatic colors green and red, dependent on the amount of fluorescence expressed under UV light.

Currently, there are no ultimate solutions to manage the spread of Fusarium oxysporum, an asexual-reproducing fungal pathogen that can remain in soil, tissue, and organic residues asymptomatically in an endophyte form. Our project addresses the issue of the Panama wilt disease. Caused by the Fusarium oxysporum pathogenic fungus, it clogs the plant's xylem vessels, leading to water and nutrient deprivation, defoliation, and plant death. Our solution involves genetically modifying bacteria for early detection of F. oxysporum. A genetic circuit with a fusaric acid inducible promoter is activated by fusaric acid produced by the fungus. Upon detection, bacteria produces AHL through LuxI protein to communicate via quorum sensing. Other bacteria were modified to form complex with the AHL and produce more AHL through the LuxI/LuxR complex.

4958	IISER-Bhopal	KeratiNoMore	The increasing population, coupled with rising living standards, has led to a dramatic rise in the production and consumption of chicken meat. In 2023 alone, global chicken meat production is estimated to be 103.4 million tons, generating about 8.38 million tons of feather waste. Feather, made up of keratin, is recalcitrant to natural degradation and remains stable in the environment for 5-7 years, during which it causes a host of environmental and health hazards. The structural recalcitrance of keratin is due to the extensive disulphide crosslinks. Thus, the key to feather degradation lies in reducing these bonds. The enzyme cysteine dioxygenase inherent to Bacillus subtilis enables the secretion of sulphite to facilitate this reduction of disulphide bonds. Genes coding for cysteine dioxygenase, potent keratinases and a functional kill switch will be cloned to generate recombinant Bacillus subtilis. These bacteria will degrade feathers inside a fermentor efficiently and safely.

4963	BITSPilani-Goa-India	Project CARKinos - a better way to treat Lung Cancer	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 82% of all cancer cases in India and has an extremely poor prognosis. A characteristic specific to solid tumors is Antigen-Heterogeneity on the surface. This property neutralizes antigen-specific treatments, like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) - T therapy. To mitigate this problem, we propose a treatment which targets the adhesion mechanism of the tumor and disintegrates it. STAT3 inhibition, which focuses on this property, is thus exploited to aid CAR T-cell treatment. This treatment is centered on the drug Honokiol which inhibits STAT3. The drug is extracellularly displayed on T-cells via a modified Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) construct, and is to be released by the CB1 antagonist AM-6538 near the tumor site, thus minimizing side-effects of both CAR T and the drug. The treatment therefore expands the utility of CAR T therapy while also introducing genetically modified vectors as agents of drug delivery.

4971	PIHS-Beijing	Optimization of Human Lactoferrin Expression in E. coli With Addition of Ferric and Ferrous Ions	Lactoferrin is a very important glycoprotein found namely in mammal lactation and colostrum. It plays crucial roles in iron transportation and immunity of neonates. Currently, possible solutions for children without direct access to human lactoferrin are substitution with other mammalian lactoferrin, extracted human lactoferrin from breast milk and recombinant production using eukaryotes. Each one has their own issues. Prokaryotic production of human lactoferrin has been largely inefficient due to the protein’s strong bactericidal abilities. We have expressed human lactoferrin in E. coli in different conditions.We found patterns indicating beneficial effects of the added ions on bacterial survival on top of producing functioning proteins. This points us farther along the way of finding a more efficient and economically friendly method of human lactoferrin production through prokaryotic expression under optimum conditions.

4973	PatrasBio	Using synthetic biology and biotechnology methods for the preservation of the marble monuments	Bioerosion is defined as any undesirable change that occurs in a material and is due to the activity of microorganisms. This phenomenon threatens marble monuments around the world, therefore its limitation is a matter of paramount importance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse class of amphipathic molecules, produced by many tissues and cell types in a variety of invertebrates, plant and animal. AMPs enter the pores of the cell membrane, thereby damaging and killing microorganisms. The aim of this study is to evaluate their activity as key components of a biological biocide. The experimental procedures involve the transformation of E. coli strains with recombinant plasmids containing the desired nucleotide sequence of antimicrobial peptides. After isolation, characterization of the expression and purity of the peptides under study, their efficacy is assessed on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi and viruses found in marbles.

4974	NYCEmpireState	Aptamers for the Detection of Stress-Related Salivary Biomarkers	Our motivation was to create an inexpensive and non-invasive aptamer-based approach to assess saliva samples to detect acute stress by clinicians in order to diagnose patients. Through collaboration, we obtained labeled DNA probes with specificity to alpha-amylase. We used an EMSA to visualize the binding of those probes to our protein. We also began work on synthesizing a plasmid to express alpha-amylase in the lab for future experiments. We were able to show a specific interaction between the alpha-amylase and aptamer complex within a polyacrylamide gel. The interaction of the protein-DNA complex traveled a shorter distance versus probe and protein alone. The study shows that synthetic DNA oligonucleotides make for an equally efficient method to detect alpha-amylase versus the traditional ELISA antibody. In the future, we will apply this method to human samples via saliva collection which is less invasive than a blood draw.

4977	Liuan-Shanghai	Synthetic Biofilms: A Greener and Safer Solution for Food Preservation	Food waste has been on the rise, prompting the development of food preservation films using biopolymers. However, these materials lack antibacterial properties, necessitating the use of additives. Synthetic biology offers a greener and safer approach by integrating antibacterial peptides into materials. In this project, we aimed to create food preservation films with extended decay time using existing biopolymer materials. We introduced antimicrobial peptides into silk fibroin-based films via a biological synthesis approach, starting with cecropin-1 but switching to Magainin-2 due to toxicity issues. These peptides were then integrated with silk protein solution to form fresh-keeping films that can be sprayed and coated on vegetables and fruits. To reduce costs, we further introduced low-cost antibacterial peptide Nisin, which is obtained from natural products. Our research demonstrated the market potential of our product, and we aim to achieve productization in the near future.

4999	Harvard	E.CoDROP: Rapid Production of ATPS Droplet-Suspended Cell-Free Extract Systems	Research and diagnostic tools for high-throughput molecular detection can typically target only a single analyte or class of analytes at a time. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is suspending cell-free expression (CFE) detection systems in aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplets, then spatially assembling different protocell droplets into an assay capable of detecting diverse analytes. However, this approach necessitates costly preparation of cell-free lysates. Thus, we developed E.CoDROP, a novel method for rapidly creating cell extracts within ATPS droplets. To create these droplets, Escherichia coli cells grow to exponential growth phase, pellet and resuspend in Ficoll (10 w/v%), and vortex with 35k PEG (5 w/v%). Within the resultant ATPS droplets, cells lyse, caused by a gene cassette under control of an arabinose-inducible pBAD system. Lysis releases cell contents, including transcription-translation machinery and any plasmid-encoded molecular detection systems. These droplets are then suitable for use in the aforementioned CFE detection systems.

These factors can cause hair to lose its luster, become dry, brittle, patchy, and less elastic. It may also cause problems such as discoloration, split ends, and hair breakage. To address these common hair problems, we used bioengineering techniques to engineer E. coli to produce a short peptide that repairs hair damage. In addition, we have integrated a glutathione production system to maintain hair health, and added tyrosinase genes to help the conversion of melanin to maintain the natural color of the hair. This innovative biotechnology provides new possibilities for hair care, not only repairing damaged hair, but also maintaining hair health and color.

5005	GEC-CHINA	Directed evolution to elevate bio-production of NAD+ for anti-ageing	As the aging population continues to grow, the treatment of aging and age-related diseases has become an important societal issue. NAD+ is a critical molecule in cellular metabolism and life span, but its levels decline with age. NAMPT is the key enzyme for NAD+ synthesis, however, the catalytic activity of human NAMPT is extremely low. Therefore, our project aims to harness the power of directed evolution to select the NAMPT mutant form with superior activity and accelerate the bio-production of NAD+ and its application in anti-aging therapy. We established the TRACE system and used the NAD+ biosensor FiNad to characterize the changes in NAMPT activity, thereby screening highly active NAMPT mutants, providing a theoretical basis for improving the NAD+ synthesis process and reducing costs. The successful implementation of this project is expected to alleviate the social burden caused by aging and age-related diseases which has significant research and application value.

5016	MunichBioinformatics	SEPiA - Side-Effects and Polypharmacy interaction Ai	Polypharmacy is the simultaneous use of more than five medications. While often necessary for treating multimorbid patients, polypharmacy is associated with a decline in the patient's health outcomes. Polypharmacy presents a complex side effect profile affecting 15% of the general population in the US, rising sharply with age and poor health. Additionally, with increasing life expectancy worldwide, understanding polypharmacy will only become more critical in the coming years. Because more drugs cause an exponential increase in possible drug combinations, systematic laboratory testing is impractical. Computational approaches have only focused on pairwise drug-drug interactions. Therefore, bioinformatics approaches are needed to extend current methodologies to arbitrary numbers of drugs. We use graph-based deep learning algorithms applied to polypharmacy hypergraphs and chemical language models to predict the effects of many drugs interacting. Using this approach, we reached AUROC 0.895 using a pairwise drug-drug interaction dataset from Dacagon and 0.982 for multi-drug polypharmacy interactions.

5017	Patras-Med	Project ‘’Herophilus’’: breaking the barriers against pancreatic cancer.	Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers for which survival has not substantially improved over the last 25 years. Nowadays, Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy (CAR Therapy) has entered clinical practice. It is characterized as “living therapy” and CAR Natural Killer (CAR-NK) cells as “living drugs.” We aim to construct CAR-NK cells derived from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) through second-generation lentiviral plasmids to bind specifically to Mesothelin (MSLN), a GPI-anchored protein on the membrane of pancreatic cancer cells, inducing immune response. Targeting MSLN will be achieved by combining the CAR-NK structural units, which provide advanced cytotoxic activity, and a single chain Fragment-variable (scFv), which binds to MSLN even after its partial degradation by proteolytic enzymes. Thus, the project “Herophilus” aims to propose a new therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy, utilizing CAR-NK cells and iPSCs derived from somatic cells of healthy donors.

However, if the body is unable to efficiently excrete uric acid, uric acid level will rise, forming urate crystal and deposit in the joints and surrounding soft tissue, causing a painful and inflammatory response that lead to joint pain, and swelling. Some animals use urate oxidase to catalyze the conversion of uric acid into allantoin, which helps reduce the accumulation of uric acid in the body. Therefore, this project uses probiotics to express enzymes such as urate oxidase to degrade excess uric acid in the body, thereby reducing the risk of gout.

5035	IEA	AI-Driven Enzyme Engineering for PFAS Degradation Using Protein LLM, Expression Classifier, and Cell-Free Expression	"PFAS, or ""forever chemicals,"" are toxic compounds linked to cancers, infertility, and vaccine resistance at concentrations below 1 ppt. The IEA iGEM team is employing AI to design enzymes that break down PFAS through a four-step process: 1. Using protein large language models (pLLMs) and a new enzyme classifier to generate novel PFAS-degrading enzymes. 2. Computationally validating the predicted catalytic activity of these enzymes against PFAS. 3. Assessing the expressibility of the enzymes in a cell-free system to ensure feasibility for lab testing, and as input for a expression classifier that we design. 4. Expressing enzymes successfully, and then sent to a specialized lab to confirm PFAS degradation activity. By combining AI-driven protein design with experimental validation, our approach seeks to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution to combat the environmental and health risks posed by PFAS."

5036	AFCM-Egypt	SONG-H: a modular therapeutic platform for tissue healing using cell-based regenerative medicine and gene therapy.	Burn injuries are devastating wounds associated with serious complications including infection, disfiguring scarring, and contractures which require intensive medical intervention to alleviate their physical and psychological impact. This year, we are tackling this challenge by developing SONG-H (Stem cell-based Occlusive Nutritive Gel of Healing). Our approach is based on promoting the SCs' regenerative capacities and enhancing the healing process of non-regenerative tissues besides using hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel as a scaffold for topical delivery. We integrated two modular devices to control our therapeutic approach. Firstly, we've designed a novel programmable receptor that is specific and sensitive to the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) within the burn microenvironment, which triggers conditioned expression of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP-1) that regulates the differentiation and proliferation rate of SCs. Secondly, we utilized SCs' exosomal signaling ability to deliver YAP-1 transcripts within our Translation Initiation Device (TID) modular protein-based switch.

5038	CJUH-JLU-China	Heartecho: A cancer screening kit for post-myocardial infarction patients	Patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as myocardial infarction (MI) have an increased risk of developing cancer. The emerging research field of reverse cardio-oncology demonstrates that multiple cardiovascular diseases including MI could promote cancer progression. To identify MI patients at risk of developing cancer, we designed a screening kit Heartecho that employs a Loop-Initiated RNA Activator (LIRA)-based system to detect microRNAs that are both highly expressed in MI patients and capable of promoting cancer. We employed bioinformatics methods to identify two microRNAs, miR-142-3p and miR-210-3p, as optimal biomarkers, and designed LIRAs that target these two microRNAs. Finally, we chose chromogenic method to show results visibly. The detection liquid will change color from yellow to purple to indicate the presence of these two microRNAs in the samples. As a new detection system, Heartecho provides a rapid and simple way to help MI patients aware of risk of cancer.

5041	HongKong-CUHK	ResiSense - A rapid point-of-care test kit for detecting bacterial antibiotic resistance genes	Bacterial antibiotic resistance, exacerbated by antibiotic misuse and overuse, has become a global health crisis responsible for millions of deaths, particularly in underdeveloped areas. However, current diagnostic strategies require highly-trained personnel and expensive on-site equipment, which are often infeasible in low-resource settings. To help alleviate these challenges, we propose ResiSense, a cell-free point-of-care strategy tailored to rapidly detect bacterial antibiotic resistance genes. In the presence of a targeted resistance gene, a selected G-quadruplex DNAzyme will be produced from a strategically designed DNA template by rolling circle amplification (RCA). The DNAzyme oxidises colourless tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into blue TMB?, resulting in colourimetric detection. As a proof of concept, we generated a non-infectious Escherichia coli strain containing a short snippet of blaKPC2, an antibiotic resistance gene derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and we successfully detected the gene via the RCA-generated DNAzyme. ResiSense represents a rapid and economical technology that could accurately detect antibiotic resistance.

Freshwater oil spills often lead to the formation of oil in water emulsions, which make conventional cleanup methods less effective. A particular concern are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), toxic and carcinogenic components of oil that pose significant threats to ecosystems. Therefor, we want to bioremediate PAHs using synthetic biology. Our chosen bioremediation chassis is Pseudomonas vancouverensis DSM8368, which naturally degrades three PAHs, naphthalene, fluorene and phenanthrene. We genetically introduced nine enzyme coding sequences into this chassis. Creating a metabolic pathway, which channels pyrene degradation into the native phenanthrene degradation pathway. To ensure biosafety, the modified bacteria will be immobilized inside a device, which can be installed at target sides in rivers. Polluted water and native bacteria will pass it, giving our chassis the opportunity to break down PAHs."

5046	Patras	LipOdyssey: A Quest For Precision Treatment	Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, with a mortality rate in Greece reaching 25%. Despite being a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, current therapies often struggle with drug resistance, limiting long-term outcomes and contributing to disease progression. Inspired by recent vaccine advancements, we aim to develop a targeted therapy for the aggressive HER2+ subtype. Up to 70% of HER2-positive breast cancer patients develop resistance to trastuzumab, reducing its effectiveness. Our approach uses RNA-based gene silencing delivered via lipid nanoparticles, enhanced with trastuzumab to improve targeting and efficacy. Once inside the cells, the nanoparticles release shRNA to silence the TERT gene, lowering telomerase activity. This dual approach disrupts cancer cell immortality and increases sensitivity to trastuzumab, thereby overcoming resistance. Our project's combination of targeted therapy and gene silencing offers a precise, promising strategy with the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and bring hope to patients.

5047	UNILausanne	Vespa velutina Eradication through gene Silencing and Precise Ai based recognition	The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina), an invasive species introduced in France in 2004, poses a significant threat to pollinators, especially honeybees, impacting biodiversity and food security across Europe. This leads to significant economic losses, underscoring the need for urgent solutions. Our project offers a novel approach: a box equipped with an image recognition software containing a bait inoculated with engineered Lactococcus lactis. The software can distinguish insects and ensures that only the Asian hornet is granted access to the bait. When the bait is consumed by the larvae, the bacteria deliver shRNA to disrupt key developmental genes via RNA interference. By targeting specific genes, this method minimises harm to other species. And by targeting larvae, this method aims to reduce hornet populations more efficiently than current methods. Our design is efficient, cost-effective, and offers a promising solution to the growing threat of Asian hornets in Europe.

5048	WHU-China	Intestide	Small peptides possess notable attributes. However, existing methods for delivering short peptides into the intestine remain constrained. Our proposed design encompasses three modules--Secretion, Adhesion, and Biosafety--and involves two strains of engineered bacteria: peptide producers and controllers. The Secretion module is present in the peptide producer strain. This module features a transmembrane protein, integrated into the outer membrane of E. coli. Synthesis of small peptides occurs in conjunction with this transmembrane protein, enabling their delivery into the surrounding environment. Both the peptide producer and controller strains incorporate the Adhesion module, which employs two adhesins capable of binding to each other. This arrangement results in the formation of a strain-layered matrix that securely adheres to the intestinal lining. The biosafety module comprises two distinct components within two strains. Based on a reciprocal activation principle, this module regulates the population dynamics of two strains to ensure optimal small peptide production.

5059	Cornell	Scaling Ursolic Acid Biosynthesis for Breast Cancer Treatment via Gene Knockout and CSTR	Ursolic Acid (UA) is a natural product that has been discovered to have numerous medically beneficial properties. Preliminary studies have shown therapeutic potential for breast cancer [Seo et al., 2018]. The current method of obtaining UA requires extraction from apples and loquats, which is environmentally unsustainable [Yu et al., 2018], time-consuming, and not standardized across scientists. Although UA has high promise within oncology studies, it's also found to have low oral bioavailability, limiting its efficacy as a pharmaceutical. Team Cornell genetically engineered the mevalonate (MVA) pathway by knocking out a transport protein and introducing new enzymes within the MVA pathway. Furthermore, a high specificity carrier system was developed to assist with bioavailability. Oncurex improves the efficiency and standardization of UA biosynthesis. This project also provides an industrially scalable platform that can be utilized by pharmaceutical companies to increase UA supply for breast cancer treatment.

5060	KULeuven	NeoMineX: Engineered bacterial strains and biofibers for cation extraction from wastewater	Our reliance on technological solutions to increase and maintain a standard of living beyond the Earth's capacity, is driving the depletion of Earth's finite mineral resources. Mining ores is depleting and destroying our ecosystems, while large amounts of these metal ions end up in our waters at concentrations that can affect our ecology, but are usually too dilute to make recycling economically viable. NeoMineX aims to tackle both metal scarcity and water pollution by bioaccumulating metal ions from waste water, providing a viable route for metal recycling and recovery. In our project, we characterised 28 previously reported metal-binding peptides for their in vivo Cu (copper) and Ni (nickel) accumulation (and detoxification). We also demonstrate that these peptides could be turned into functional protein fibers for specialist applications or for environments where GMOs are not well suited.

This project introduces PHAGEVO, a novel tool that combines Phage-Assisted Non-Continuous Evolution (PANCE) and the Evolution.T7 system, providing a powerful method for in vivo protein evolution. While PANCE enables efficient selection of functional variants, it lacks targeted gene specificity. We decided to combine it with Evolution.T7, a system developed by Evry-Paris-Saclay team 2021 which enables targeted and modular double-stranded in vivo mutagenesis using RNA polymerase-guided cytosine and adenine deaminases' that introduce mutations in specific gene sequences. As a proof of concept, the project focuses on evolving the XylS transcription factor to detect plastic degradation products Phthalic Acid (PA) and Terephthalic Acid (TPA). Our project, PHAGEVO, also leverages the power of artificial intelligence to engineer XylS for PA and TPA sensitivity owing to FLINT, a model developed by our team based on PocketGen.

5062	HKU-HongKong	CAR_Ma - A next-generation in-vivo immunotherapy	Cancer is a complex disease that has plagued mankind for sometime. Humanity has developed almost as many weapons on cancer as we have on each other. Chemcial, radiological and even biological weapons have developed to little avail, due to their inability to takle the inherent complexities of cancer from the ground-up. Solid tumors act on multiple fronts simultaneously: One part rapidly growing parasitic organism, another part immune evasion, and finally one part self-sustaining microenvironment. To tackle cancer effectively, we need to be able to tackle the tumor in its multiple modalities, with a solution that is inherently multi-modal. CAR_Ma is this solution. Built upon our own multi-modal RNA - Combining sustained, controllable and transient expression, gene editing and modulation, and our nanoparticle delivery solution. We are able to engineer macrophages capable of targeting tumor cells, negating immune evasion, then penetrating and destroying the tumor from the inside out.

This results in the buildup of TMA, causing a strong odor released through sweat, breath, and urine. The 2024 iGEM@FSU team is continuing efforts initiated by the 2023 team to address this rare condition. Building on the previous team's therapeutic development, the current team is creating a biomarker monitoring device, specifically a breathalyzer that utilizes a BIOFET sensor. This device aims to provide patients with a reliable method to monitor their TMA levels and adjust treatments more effectively. The project also seeks to integrate last year's therapeutic approach with this diagnostic tool for a comprehensive management solution.

In our project, we successfully engineered 12 recombinant biolarvicidal toxins and partially reproduced a chromosome-free system. We conducted WHO standard larvicidal assay with Aedes albopictus larvae and proved the potency of Cyt2Ba, Xpp81Aa1 and BmK IT1. In addition, we consistently proved that 2.5 mg/ml of beetroot peel powder can significantly attract gravid female Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in oviposition assays. We integrated the synthetic biology-based product with beetroot peel powder and developed Taiwan's first 3D-printed household-use sticky ovitrap. We also developed an OpenCv mosquito egg analyzer to automatically analyze mosquito eggs, helping field entomologists and scientists in dengue surveillance work. Dengue Beeters is an exciting project that breaks mosquito life cycle through synthetic biology and contributes to the end of dengue fever disease by 2030.

Existing detection methods for heavy metals often suffer from limitations such as lengthy processing times, high costs, and inadequate sensitivity, making them less effective for real-time monitoring. This project aims to develop a whole-cell biosensor leveraging the natural pigments to visually indicate the heavy metals in water. By integrating metal-responsive transcriptional regulators MerR and CadR with the pigment biosynthesis gene clusters, we engineered E. coli as the biosensor capable of detecting Hg (II) and Cd (II). The biosensor exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity, with clear colorimetric changes correlated to metal ion concentrations. This innovative biosensor offers a promising tool for environmental monitoring, enabling rapid and accessible detection of heavy metal pollutants, and could be further adapted for use in various ecological and industrial applications, enhancing environmental safety and public health initiatives.

Our reSkin hydrogel is based on photo-crosslinking the natural components resilin and hyaluronic acid using riboflavin phosphate as photo-initiator. Resilin is a protein found in insects. It is well known for its exceptional mechanical properties and resilience. Hyaluronic acid is a negatively charged polymer with an extremely high water capacity. This allows for the hydration of the burn wound and the absorption of the wound fluid. To support wound healing, prevent inflammation, and promote the regeneration of skin tissue, we have added astaxanthin, bromelain, and vitamin E to our hydrogel. Furthermore, the protease bromelain helps to differentiate between degrees 2a and 2b of the burn injury and is therefore used to assess whether a skin transplant is necessary.

5079	Queens-Canada	SynAxis - An Engineered System for Targeted Degradation of Misfolded ?-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease	Parkinson's disease (PD) presents significant healthcare challenges, affecting millions globally and currently lacking disease-modifying therapies. Our project focuses on the engineered degradation of misfolded ?-synuclein seeds, a key pathological feature in PD. Braak's staging of PD highlights a progressive spread of pathological ?-synuclein seeds, starting in the enteric nervous system within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and advancing to the central nervous system. We developed a modular protein switch designed to selectively degrade pathological ?-synuclein in enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the gastrointestinal tract. This switch is activated by an output domain (CypD), ensuring degradation by the input domain (KLK6) occurs only in the presence of misfolded ?-synuclein, thereby minimizing off-target effects. An oral spore-based probiotic delivery system encapsulates the switch, facilitating its targeted release to EECs. Our approach aims to change PD treatment by addressing the underlying pathology rather than merely managing symptoms and providing a strategy suitable for other synucleinopathies.

The first plasmid expresses LuxR under the control of the strong promoter J23119, enabling high LuxR protein levels. AHL molecules bind to LuxR, forming a complex that activates the second plasmid, which contains a Lux promoter driving the expression of the fluorescent protein VenusNB. The resulting fluorescence is proportional to the bacterial contamination, providing a reliable method to assess milk spoilage.

5081	Squirrel-Beijing-I	A soothing nasal suction complex, no taboos to ride a roller coaster!	Riding a roller coaster is a thrilling entertainment activity, however, adverse reactions unavoidably occur, such as dizziness, vomiting, head tremors. In addition, activities related with vestibular functions including riding, boating and bungee jumping would also bring the similar side effects. Based on our recent invivo studies, vitamin B6 and B12 took effects in nourishing vestibular functional areas mainly through increasing the permeability of vascular endothelial cells and regulating special signal pathways. Therefore, in the present project, we planned to research and develop a soothing nasal suction complex to minimize vestibular function damages. Through constructing neurons damage model, the effects of VB6/VB12 and their combinations in alleviating neuron injuries were primarily evaluated, and their best ratio were selected, the molecular mechanism was further validated.. Then, VB6/VB12 nanoparticles were prepared with ursolic acid, to promise the slow-release effects. With feedback gathering, we hope to create an effective and novel remedy.

5082	YiYe-China	The Application of RNA Secondary Structure to Diagnose Gastric Cancer in the Early Stage	Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Ras?GTPase?activating protein SH3 domain binding protein1 (G3BP1) is the first RasGAP SH3 domain binding protein. G3BP1 has been reported to be upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and strongly associated with the survival rate of the patients suffering from gastric cancer. G3BP1 protein could directly regulate the mRNA decay through interacting with the highly structure in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Our project plans to create a sensor containing highly structured 3'UTR to monitor the change of G3BP1, which may provide a novel method to diagnosis gastric cancer at the earlier stages in the future.

5084	GEC-Guangzhou	Smart Probiotic for Early IBD Detection and Treatment	Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) causes intestinal damage and inflammation, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and recurring episodes. Current diagnostic and treatment methods are insufficient. Colonoscopies, the main diagnostic tool, are invasive and costly, while medications can suppress symptoms but have side effects. Our project aims to create a smart engineered probiotic for early IBD prediction and treatment. This probiotic detects elevated thiosulfate levels in the gut, triggering a sensory system that turns the patient's stool blue to indicate IBD. For treatment, the bacteria release Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) to heal the intestinal lining. A safety kill-switch system ensures no environmental release or persistence in the human body. This integrated diagnostic and therapeutic approach offers a more convenient, affordable, and precise solution for early IBD detection and treatment, potentially reducing its incidence.

5085	SJTU-Software	HEATMAP: Harmonizing Enzymatic Activity and Temperature in Metabolic Pathways	The optimization of metabolic pathway within the Saccharopolyspora spinosa plays an irreplaceable role in increasing purity and unit yield of spinosad. Enzymes, as essential components of life, have long been a research focal point. One of their fundamental characteristics, optimal temperature, serves as a key link between biological activity and temperature. In this project, we set up a deep learning model to predict the optimal temperatures of enzymes within the body of Saccharopolyspora spinosa and compared them to the actual fermentation temperatures to identify enzymes with large differences. These enzymes became our key targets for optimization. Moreover, to simplify the optimization, based on the GEM model, we added enzyme and temperature constraints to construct the etcGEM model so that key enzymes with yield limitations can be identified. Targeted evolution of these key enzymes brings their optimal temperatures closer to the actual fermentation temperatures, thus improves productivity.

In our iGEM project, we engineered SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter Unlocking), a synthetic biology tool, to specifically and effectively detect the Oder strain of Prymnesium parvum. We developed a lateral flow test - PrymFlow - for in-field detection, as well as a 3D-printed device - PrymChip. Additionally, we created SynLOCK - the crRNA Synthesis System for SHERLOCK - which simplifies and standardizes the production of custom crRNAs, making it easier to develop detection tools similar to ours.

Consultations with experts revealed that the primary limitation in dandelion cultivation is not rubber yield but agriculturally significant traits like plant morphology. To address this, we developed a comprehensive collection of characterized genetic parts specific to dandelions, including constitutive regulatory elements. We tested our constructs using four transformation methods - two transient (leaf infiltration and protoplast transformation) and two stable (""extremely simplified cut-dip-budding"" and sterile transformation).

5089	UManitoba	RePLAse - compost accelerator, that helps improve PLA plastics degradation under standard commercial composting conditions.	The problem of petroleum-based plastic pollution persists for over 50 years. Biotechnology has enabled more sustainable plastic options to gain popularity. PLA plastics are marketed as biodegradable, but they require high temperatures, sustained moisture, and 20 times more organic matter to decompose. Compost facilities in Manitoba are unable to accept PLA because its degradation requirements are not compatible with current infrastructure. We designed a bio-based compost accelerator that facilitates PLA degradation without disrupting natural composting processes, and improves compost quality. Our final design consists of gram-negative compost-native bacteria, Pseudomonas putida, with a surface-display mechanism involving an anchor protein, PLA-specific adhesion protein and PLA depolymerases optimized for composting conditions. We tested three PLA-degrading enzymes against both short and long chain PLA and determined that our device has the potential to degrade target both the amorphous and crystalline regions of PLA when used in concert.

5090	Stony-Brook	Micronaut: A Biosensor for Non-Hodgkin's B-cell Lymphoma	Non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma is a deadly disease that currently lacks early screening tests. Often, patients are diagnosed at advanced stages due to ambiguous symptoms, making it much more difficult to treat. Studies have shown that many diseases, including non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, have microRNA signatures - associated increases or decreases in the concentrations of certain microRNAs. Existing microRNA detectors such as toehold switch-based systems require complex secondary structure modeling. We engineered Micronaut, a novel microRNA biosensor that takes advantage of the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) and a dual regulation system. Our GFP reporter gene is suppressed by transcriptional and translational repressors (LacI and L7Ae, respectively). In the presence of our target microRNA, the two repressors will be silenced by RISC, leading to a fluorescence signal. With a simple switch in a 20-nucleotide sequence, our system can be expanded to measure any microRNA and thus, any disease with a microRNA signature.	Diagnostics	Gold Medal			2024	J.

Additionally, we explored biopesticide strategies involving Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens to reduce spore loads. Our main achievement lies in the early design stages of a competitive format LFA, which offers farmers a potential quick and accessible method for pathogen detection, complemented by future biopesticide solutions to manage clubroot disease.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) has a significant economic impact on cattle production, as approximately 15% of cattle in North America are treated each year. BRD is caused by several different bacterial and viral pathogens. The four most common bacterial pathogens are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Misdiagnosis of infected cattle can lead to an increase in antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and loss of antibiotic efficacy. Currently, only traditional bacterial culture and PCR analysis of the pathogens can provide accurate diagnosis; however, results can take up to a week.

5096	Lambert-GA	SHIELD: A New Generation of Antimicrobials to Combat Resistance	The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as the biggest global public health threat of the 21st century. AMR occurs when microorganisms evolve to resist antibiotics, rendering traditional treatments ineffective- a process exacerbated by the current misuse of antibiotics in agriculture and healthcare. To combat AMR, Lambert iGEM created SHIELD: a versatile toolbox for developing novel antimicrobials that combat antibiotic-resistant diseases. SHIELD uses the CRISPR-interference system to silence critical genes in target organisms, alongside a toehold biosensor to measure the extent of gene silencing. We also developed SWORD: a machine learning software tool to optimize toehold design, and LabPilot: a frugal liquid handler to automate experimentation. SHIELD enables researchers to rapidly develop multiple antimicrobials for a single disease by targeting several genes, circumventing the emergence of resistance in a single gene without compromising overall treatment effectiveness, thus SHIELD empowers researchers to outpace antibiotic resistance.

5104	UMaryland	CerviCare - Urine-Based, Point-of-Care Cervical Precancer Screening	"In 2022, lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bore 94% of cervical cancer deaths, highlighting global disparity in treating the fourth-most common cancer in women. Screening access is a major contributor to decreased mortality in higher-income countries; however, existing tools rely on equipment and personnel inaccessible in LMICs. We propose CerviCare: an accessible, urine-based point-of-care cervical precancer screening tool that bridges the screening gap by avoiding barriers like cost, refrigeration, patient discomfort, and reliance on specialized equipment. To screen for precancer, we target an emerging biomarker - microRNAs (miRNAs), which are increasingly viewed as viable targets. Through review, we identified three upregulated miRNAs in cervical precancer patient urine. We utilize miRNA-optimized toehold switches, RNA riboregulators that allow downstream protein expression when bound to a target RNA, to detect these miRNAs. By deploying these toeholds alongside a low-cost portable reader, users can screen themselves for cervical precancer in an accessible manner."

The UOregon iGEM team is developing a probiotic therapeutic to replace antibiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal (Gl) tract infections. Our genetically modified strain of E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a modular platform that selectively identifies and destroys a targeted Gl pathogen. Our EcN probiotic will specifically recognize EHEC cells and deliver a malicious DNA payload through a type of horizontal gene transfer known as conjugation. As antibiotics decrease in efficacy over time, the development of a comprehensive treatment for bacterial infections is crucial and our EcN probiotic seeks to fill this growing need.

5106	WageningenUR	miRADAR: a paper-based test to simplify MS diagnosis	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that impacts nearly 3 million people worldwide. For 10% - 30% of patients in the Netherlands alone, proper diagnosis can take months or even years due to the lack of a specific MS biomarker. To simplify MS diagnosis, miRADAR designed an accessible diagnostic test based on dysregulated miRNA patterns in blood. To detect these miRNAs, our test consisted of miRNA amplification, an RNA threshold detection system, and output signal generation using toehold switch logic gate circuits. Through multiple models we found eight unique miRNA biomarkers distinguishing MS from similar diseases, and designed optimal logic gate circuits. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a cell-free paper-based test that successfully detected an MS-relevant miRNA. With our test, we provide a modular framework for miRNA-detection to improve diagnosis of MS and many other diseases.

For the 2024 iGEM competition, the DTU Biobuilders are addressing this problem with ENDOSENSE, a low-cost, cell-free, novel biosensor based on the ROSALIND system. Our sensor utilizes human hormone-binding receptors and operates as an effect-based system capable of detecting non-predetermined targets. Its design allows for a rapid, cost-effective solution suitable for on-site applications. Additionally, we developed SENTINEL, a tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to identify EDC interactions with target proteins, helping researchers analyze literature more efficiently and accelerating research. With ENDOSENSE and SENTINEL, DTU Biobuilders contribute to improving water quality, enhancing public health, and protecting marine biodiversity (SDGs 6, 3, 14), moving closer to a future where drinking tap water is safe for everyone.

We have developed a biostimulant based on an engineered bacterium Pseudomonas Fluorescens that uses in situ resources to support plant growth directly on lunar soil. As a substrate for growing bacteria, we chose creatinine, a molecule present in human urine. We identified genes to metabolize creatinine, creA and crnA, and created a new strain that was able to grow on creatinine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. The new pathway was implemented in silico into a genome-wide model of P. fluorescens that helped us predict metabolic fluxes. Moreover, we demonstrated that our engineered strain survived and could promote growth of a model plant in the laboratory on a lunar soil simulant. Capitalizing on these results, we built an entrepreneurship strategy to commercialize our biostimulant for space and terrestrial agriculture.

SurPFAS derives from ""surface"", as we intend to surface-express two classes of degradative enzymes, laccases and dehalogenases, in Escherichia coli chassis. The best enzymatic candidates will be carefully selected through bioinformatic analysis. Genetic sequences will then be cloned into Escherichia coli, generating two populations of bacteria exposing PFAS-degrading enzymes on their surface. Our system also involves PFAS filtration from ground water and the following desorption from filtering substrates.

KN2OCKOUT aims to reduce emissions by using nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR). Our team enhanced the N2O reduction pathway in denitrifying bacteria by designing a two-plasmid system using the nos gene cluster from P.stutzeri ZoBell, with nosZ and nosR in the first plasmid, and nosC, nosDFY, nosL, ApbE and tatE in the second. In the lab, we built and transformed another insert to synthesise ComR in DH5? E.Coli. Upregulated comR leads to the downregulation of comC and more copper in the periplasm, thus increasing the rate of enzymatic activity. We also built a GFP reporter insert capable of measuring the efficacy of ComR. The design proposed would be a step forward in N2O bioremediation if achieved, specifically within the National Health Service, which annually releases 150,000 tonnes of N2O.

5112	Leiden	The Affordable Library-based Pipeline for Accelerated Creation of single-domain Antibodies (A.L.P.A.C.A.)	Nanobodies are powerful tools because of their advantages over conventional antibodies, but their potential remains untapped due to lengthy and expensive development processes that employ animal immunisation and inefficient screening techniques. Addressing this, iGEM Leiden is introducing an efficient and animal-free pipeline for the development of nanobodies: ALPACA. This novel approach uses yeast surface display of bispecific nanobodies to screen a synthetic nanobody library for binders to an antigen-of-choice. ALPACA assesses the antigen-binding abilities of library nanobodies based on steric hindrance between the binding of the antigen to library nanobodies, and GFP to GFP-binding nanobodies. Desired antigen-binding yeast cells with reduced green fluorescence are collected through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). DNA of antigen-binding nanobodies is then easily retrieved for further development and production. Our ALPACA system supports the widespread implementation of nanobodies, removing large obstacles in their development, and foregoing the need for animal testing entirely.

The health risk PFAS creates is not fully understood but has been implicated in several things including cancers. Our team attempted to combat this problem through three approaches attempting to develop an optimal PFAS detection circuit: the first uses the promoter prmA as it has been documented to upregulate gene expression when exposed to PFAS; the second uses a FAB-GFP-containing gene circuit which was hypothesized via molecular dynamics simulations to bind to PFAS because of its fatty acid structure; the third uses a synthetic transcription factor that responds to estradiol in yeast as PFOA may be a strong estrogen receptor agonist.

We envisioned that this mechanism could be repurposed to rupture endosomes and lysosomes to administer therapeutics directly into a cell's cytosol. We have designed a series of R body proteins with conjugation handles to attach drugs or excipients to them, and conducted a series of in vitro assays to demonstrate their potential as a modular chassis for drug delivery.

A recent research article by Pavan et al. (2023) described native guanine crystal production in Aeromonas strains. We sought to transfer the genetic principles of these bacteria to E. coli, a more manageable and industrially scalable strain. In our model, we transform the bacteria with two genetic systems: guaA and guaB genes to enhance guanine synthesis, and CRISPRi silencing of the guanine degradation genes guaD and xdh. In concert, these two systems we hypothesise will result in guanine accumulation and eventually vegan and ethical guanine crystal formation.

We designed two programmable genetic systems for beneficial and harmful metabolites. Both system use deoxycholic acid as an indicator of food intake to trigger the subsequent responses. We focused on butyrate and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) as the beneficial and harmful metabolites, respectively. When butyrate level is low, our platform will supplement butyrate by expressing butyrate-producing enzymes. On the other hand, when IAA level is too high, our platform will express IAA-degrading enzymes to reduce excessive IAA.

5128	KhanLabSchool	Eat Methane!	Greenhouse gasses play a significant role in climate change, with carbon dioxide contributing to 79.7% of total emissions. However, while CO2 is abundant, it is not the most potent greenhouse gas. Methane has 86 times the warming impact of CO2 over 20 years yet comprising only 11.1% of emissions. Its severe environmental impact contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, which damages crops and poses significant health risks. Thus, reducing methane emissions offers a more effective climate change strategy than focusing solely on CO2. Landfills are major methane sources, contributing to 17.1% of emissions in the United States. Our project aims to address this issue by genetically modifying the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis to produce enzymes that convert methane into compounds that boost soil fertility. This innovative approach reduces methane emissions while enhancing soil health.	Climate Crisis	Silver Medal			2024	Baxter Smith, Christopher J.

5129	NU-Kazakhstan	SanaGel: Targeted ductal carcinoma bacteriotherapy	SanaGel is an innovative targeted ductal carcinoma bacteriotherapy developed using synthetic biology, ??molecular biology, and materials science methods. The system comprises non-pathogenic Escherichia coli genetically engineered to produce a tumor-targeting peptide that selectively binds cell surfaces of cancer cells and forms pores, leading to tumor cell burst and eradication. Aside from the peptide's efficiency, we have implemented a Kill Switch (Suicide Gene) to ensure higher levels of safety control. Modified bacteria are encapsulated into agarose and chitosan-based hydrogel scaffolds, solidifying upon temperature rise after the intratumoral injection. Due to the careful fine-tuning of the gel's pores and sol-gel transition temperatures, hydrogels minimize bacterial leakage and ensure the system's local action. The project has the potential of opening the door to the development of novel sustainable cancer therapeutics that are not only efficient but also exhibit reduced systemic side effects on the healthy cells of patients.

5138	UChicago	VIPR: Virus-Inspired Particle Recombinant Vaccine for Schistosomiasis	Schistosomiasis is a World Health Organization (WHO)-listed Neglected Tropical Disease characterized by the blood-dwelling helminths. Currently, all schistosomiasis vaccine candidates based on recombinant subunit antigens have encountered setbacks at various stages of clinical trials, underscoring the formidable challenges in vaccine development. Critically, these subunit vaccines lack the three-dimensional macrostructure necessary for optimal recognition by B cells as pathogenic. Drawing inspiration from Professor Mark Howarth's group's SpyCatcher-SpyTag system, a protein couple tool for peptide and protein ligation, our objective is to conjugate schistosomiasis antigens on virus-like-particle (VLP) scaffold to create high-density antigen nanoparticles to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. Together with a batch of novel antigens discovered in January 2024 through unbiased phage display, our aim is to present a diverse range of schistosomiasis antigens on VLPs. Thanks to the modularity of our VIPR, we hope to accelerate vaccine development and antigen screening for helminth diseases with a complex life cycle.

5139	Concordia-Montreal	MycoMiners Remediations	In a country built largely on resource extraction, mining continues to shape Canada's landscapes and its people. Unfortunately, the impacts of mining cannot be ignored. Mine effluent - water originating from mine sites negatively impacts ecosystems and the communities living along contaminated waterways. Treating mining effluent is critical to maintain sustainable mining practices, conventional systems are often expensive and ineffective in reaching the small concentrations of contaminants required. We aim to sequester heavy metals from mining wastewater using a microbial process. A major problem with current mining practices is that they create highly acid environments that many organisms cannot tolerate. To create a bioremediation vector, we need to address the highly acidic environment that allows our microbe to be used in situ. While our initial goal is heavy metal sequestration, we are considering possible future methods for recovery of metals for circularity in the mining industry.

Click Virus is a genetically engineered vaccinia virus with modified A27L membrane protein containing three 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF) residues. To incorporate the unnatural amino acid AzF to A27L, we mutated three phenylalanine codons to amber suppressor codons (TAG) which were then translated into AzF by an artificial translation system involving amber suppressor tRNA and azidophenylalanine-specific tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. The azido groups can be covalently linked to any customized molecules via click reactions of azido and dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO), to obtain different engineered viruses for a wide variety of applications, such as targeting delivery of genes, oncolytic virus and vaccine carrier. Using folate-linked Click Virus, we achieved the directed infection to cells overexpressing folate receptors, preliminarily verifying the reliability of Click Virus.

5152	HongKong-JSS	Metalytic - Easy Automated Metal Biosensor	Our project tackles heavy metal contamination in Hong Kong, inspired by incidents like lead in public housing water and contaminations from various origins such as agricultural land pollution, misconnection of pipes, and sewage water pouring into storm drains. These concerns highlight the need for affordable, user-friendly biosensors to detect metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, and zinc. To ensure visual detection in our biosensors, we focused on using chromoprotein reporters. Then, we identified metal-inducible promoters from literature and the iGEM database, studied their characteristics, and integrated them with the chromoprotein reporter system. We successfully developed a lead biosensor and a cadmium biosensor and demonstrated that the lead biosensor is concentration-sensitive. Additionally, our hardware team developed an automated machine using IoT and AI technologies. It can cultivate the biosensors and features an automated detection and warning system, ensuring practical and accessible monitoring of heavy metal pollutants in various settings.

5154	Cambridge	MaGenTa - Designing a spatiotemporal system capable of controlling gene expression using magnetic fields	Spatiotemporal gene control is a crucial technique utilised by academics in a variety of fields, ranging from neuroscience to stem cell research. However, the tools available for the control of gene expression in cell-based systems are limited - whether by timescale, spatial resolution, cost, or a combination of the three. To overcome these limitations, we have designed our MaGenTa technology: a spatiotemporal targeting system capable of activating gene expression using a combination of magnetic fields, magnetic nano particles (MNPs) and genetic AND gates. Our system relies on the activation of cellular pathways that function independently from one another. For this, we identified 3 viable pathways: thermal, mechanical and magnetic.

5157	Jiangnan-China	The PET Degradation STORM: Unleashing PETase's Power with PET-Binding Peptides	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic pollution poses a global environmental issue, and enzymatic degradation is an ideal ecologically friendly solution, yet its efficiency is restricted by limited substrate accessibility of corresponding enzymes. Therefore, our project applied the STROM strategy to boost the degradation ability of PETase towards PET by PET-binding peptides. Initially, sixteen potential PET-binding peptides were screened using deep learning models. Subsequently, fusion proteins of these PET-binding peptides with PETase were constructed to test PET microplastic degradation and binding efficiency, identifying three efficient peptides. Through optimization, the expression levels and PET degradation properties of these fusion proteins were further enhanced. Finally, with the aid of the Mutcompute-super model, these three peptides were re-modified, further improving the expression levels and PET microplastic degradation efficiencies of their fusion proteins, with the optimal degradation efficiency reaching 207.49% of PETase. Our project provides insights and support for the biodegradation of PET plastics.

Current DHA supplement sources include fish oil and microalgae, in which the former is susceptible to pollution and predicted to decline in productivity due to global warming, and the latter faces high production costs. To provide an alternative method of efficient and sustainable DHA production, our team selects oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, a safe, commonly used organism for industrial fatty acid production as our chassis. We integrate the gene cluster encoding a specific DHA-synthesizing enzyme complex from Schizochytrium sp. into the yeast's genome. We then apply the following strategies to optimize the DHA yield: peroxisomal PEX10 gene knockout by homologous recombination to inhibit DHA degradation; control of gene expression level and production stages via promoter characterization and design; replenishing reactant NADPH supply through GapC gene introduction."

5160	SZU-China	SWEETEIN: Recombinant Thaumatin Made in Tomato Factories as the Future of Sugar Substitutes.	With increasing concerns over the health risks associated with excessive sugar consumption, the use of sugar substitutes has become widespread. However, recent studies have identified significant safety issues with many common substitutes. In response, the SZU-China team seeks to develop a safer alternative by producing Thaumatin, a natural, highly efficient, and fully digestible sweet protein. We have implemented an innovative production method within tomato fruits, utilizing two key systems: an expression system driven by the fruit-specific and ripening-induced E8 promoter for precise temporal and spatial control of Thaumatin production, and a storage-targeting system that directs Thaumatin to the vacuole using the SPS-NTPP targeting peptide. This approach enables the direct extraction of Thaumatin from tomato juice, eliminating the need for complex purification processes. We have named this protein 'Sweetein' and hope it will inspire further advancements in the sugar substitute industry by offering safer, natural alternatives for consumers.

We focus on BcoAT to enhance the synthesis of its SCFAs and program the glucose responsive secretion of GLP-1 to build a synthetic biological reactor through the method of synthetic biology, with the probiotic ECN1917 as the chassis. When blood sugar levels rise after each meal, GLP-1 is released to rapidly lower blood sugar to baseline levels. In order to achieve the above functions, this project designed a GLP-1 recombinant protein, with PelB as the lead sequence connected to GLP-1 to enhance its extracellular secretion function. DnaK, a key protein of the blood glucose control module, is expressed at the tail of GLP-1 through flexible linker peptides to achieve its programmed release. During the experimental phase, the release of GLP-1 regulated by glucose concentration was validated through gradient dilution and ELISA quantitative detection.

5162	HKSSC	Enhancing The Complement System Against Leptospira	"Leptospira, a genus of motile gram-negative spirochetes, causes leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that significantly impacts resource-poor populations. Transmitted through contaminated environments, it affects high-risk groups like agricultural workers and water sports enthusiasts. Clinical manifestations range from mild flu-like symptoms in anicteric leptospirosis to severe complications in icteric leptospirosis (Weil's disease). The complement system is crucial for immune defense; however, some Leptospira proteins evade it, complicating host responses. Recent studies have identified specific microRNAs (miRNAs), such as hsa-miR-144-3p and hsa-miR-21-5p, which down-regulate important immune components, including toll-like receptors and complement factor H. This project aims to investigate the interaction between these miRNAs and their targets to design synthetic miRNA mimics/inhibitors. The goal is to enhance the immune response, particularly TLR2 and complement factor H activity, improving defenses against leptospirosis. Over two years, this research seeks to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for managing the disease and its complications."

The least polluting method of controlling this epidemic is the use of insect repellents. However, their current production relies on petroleum and toxic intermediates, posing a major threat to the environment. So, we developed a biosynthetic pathway to produce a promising alternative to current repellents: NBP. We designed and partially constructed an enzyme cascade to produce NBP from sugar feedstocks. To improve the catalytic activity of our key enzyme, we devel-oped the software tool 'seq-mutator', which bridges the gap between AI-assisted protein engineering and real-world data, ultimately resulting in a variant with about a five-fold increase in activity. We also explored the use of black pepper as a sustainable production chassis by developing novel transformation protocols, and by producing NBP in Nicotiana benthamiana as proof of concept.

However, its requirements for low carbohydrate intake and prolonged fasting render it impractical for most individuals. To address this limitation, we have engineered E. coli to biosynthesize d-?-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body, which can substitute the need for a strict ketogenic diet to reach ketosis. Our modified bacteria first produce the polymer poly hydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is then converted to BHB through the expression of PHB depolymerase. Through rigorous testing, we successfully detected BHB production from our engineered cells, demonstrating the feasibility of our system. By facilitating easier access to the benefits of ketosis without dietary constraints, our project capitalizes on the recent development of safe and orally bioavailable ketone monoester drinks, highlighting a significant market opportunity.

Traditional sterilization methods (sunlight, chemical disinfectants, soil isolation) are ineffective and unsustainable. Instead, our project focuses on coexistence through competition. We genetically modify Fusarium oxysporum by removing the FUB1 toxin gene and introducing the RiCLE symbiotic gene from Rhizophagus irregularis, creating a strain that promotes banana growth while protecting against wild-type pathogens. The modified fungus acts as a vaccine, occupying ecological niches to fend off harmful strains. To prevent biohazard, we designed a kill switch system using tetracycline to control spore production within a specialized fermentation tank. Spores are produced safely.

These particles compromise soil structure and quality, leading to reduced crop yields and altering crucial properties such as bulk density and water retention. More severely, crops may absorb these microplastics, impairing their ability to take up nutrients and water effectively. To combat these alarming issues, we introduce PETlizer--a groundbreaking solution featuring engineered E. coli BL21 to break down microplastics and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to convert the byproducts into rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipids are powerful surfactants that enhance microbial adhesion, improve soil water retention, inhibit pathogens, and assist in pollution remediation.

Three antibiotic resistance genes, AAC(6')-Ib, ErmC, and Tet(A), were chosen for the purpose of testing these systems. Our results demonstrate that the sRNA system successfully represses the expression of ErmC and Tet(A), restoring the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotic treatment. Additionally, we explored a novel approach of transforming plasmid DNA using graphene oxide.

5177	Manchester	E.lectrode: Recombinant Skin-Specific Nanowires to Improve Signal Detection in Human-Machine Interfaces	How can synthetic biology revolutionise our connections to machines? Our bodies use electrical signals for cellular communication, and myoelectric prosthetics can translate electrical signals generated from muscle contractions in the residual limb into movement using dry metal electrodes. However, a critical limiting factor for these electrodes is the overreliance on direct contact with the skin, making them vulnerable to interference from sweat and movement. This results in the electrodes moving out of place, leading to inaccurate signal interpretation (motion artefacts), causing lagging limb movement. We aim to improve the electrode's interface using electrically conductive pili (e-pili) derived from Geobacter sulfurreducens. By combining the e-pili's PilA monomer with a skin-specific protein-binding tag on the carboxy-terminal end, we will create nanowires that adhere to the skin surface. These nanowires would decrease the distance electrical signals would need to travel without a conductor, minimising motion artefacts and improve signal detection in human-machine interfaces.

It is treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, an oral drug containing porcine-derived pancreatic enzymes. As a more ethical and economic treatment option, we present the Bacillus Lipase Integrated Secretion System (BLISS), a probiotic that secretes synthetic digestive enzymes suitable for the human body. We plan to transform B. subtilis with the human pancreatic lipase and procolipase genes, along with a glucose-mediated switch mechanism for inducible expression. We have also developed a comprehensive model to determine the timescale of enzyme production and secretion. Our device also contains a biocontainment mechanism to prevent the device from functioning in unintended environments.

Satellite phages present a vast ensemble of unexplored machinery with the potential to meet these emerging needs. Our project, SaPh:IRES (Satellite Phage: Integrated Real-world Engineering Solutions), addresses the significant foundational gap by pursuing two key objectives: developing novel identification tools for satellites both bioinformatically and experimentally, and utilizing their unique mechanisms to address specific challenges in synthetic biology. To do so, we use different phage satellite systems in mycobacteria and E. coli for three specific applications: sequence-specific population level control, overcoming prophage immunity, and increasing phage host range. We test our concepts in silico with the first of its kind mathematical model, in vitro, and in situ in simulated real-world environments to showcase their functionality at different levels of complexity.

5180	Princeton	BOOMcoli: A Therapeutic Model for Ulcerative Colitis by Probiotic-Mediated Release of IL-10	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the colon, affecting 5 million people worldwide with increasing incidence. Current treatments, targeting periods of remission and flare-ups, often fall short, with only 20-30% of patients seeing significant improvement. Our project, BOOMcoli, introduces a novel therapeutic model using bioengineered E. coli probiotics for targeted release of IL-10 in the colon. By utilizing a biomarker-sensitive promoter and quorum sensing, our engineered probiotic binds to inflamed sites identified by elevated calprotectin levels, an inflammation marker. Once localized, quorum sensing triggers synchronized lysis, releasing IL-10 precisely in the inflamed areas. BOOMcoli intends for a fast-acting, highly specific, and minimally invasive treatment that can be administered regularly to manage UC symptoms as they arise. Beyond UC, this method could be adapted for other large intestine diseases, including colorectal cancer, or other organs for broader therapeutic applications.	Therapeutics	Gold Medal			2024	José L.

5181	IISER-TVM	PETal: Valorizing PET plastic to sandalwood oil	The fashion and cosmetics industries are highly consumer-centric, impacting nearly everyone worldwide. These industries consume vast quantities of raw materials and can significantly harm the environment. Indian sandalwood oil is one such sought-after raw material in the beauty industry. PETal presents a novel solution by integrating plastic waste management with the production of sandalwood oil, using synthetic biology. Using engineered Pseudomonas putida that can metabolise the monomers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), i.e. terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), we aim to synthesise santalene and santalol, the major components of sandalwood oil. This offers a sustainable alternative to conventional sandalwood oil extraction, reducing the strain on natural populations and providing a novel method for plastic upcycling. By creating a value-added product from PET plastic waste, PETal has the potential to reshape waste management strategies, promote biodiversity conservation, and simultaneously meet the global demands for sandalwood oil.

The treatment success rate of antifungal drugs is only 67.4%, and the resistance is becoming increasingly critical. In response to this challenge, SWU-China team is focused on developing an innovative and efficient method for the high-throughput screening of antifungal peptides (AFP) utilizing deep learning techniques. The team employs the DeBERTa model to rapidly identify potential antifungal peptide sequence patterns from existing AFP data and predict the activity of candidate antimicrobial peptides from the NCBI database. Compared to conventional wet-lab methods, this model-driven approach offers significant improvements in both screening efficiency and accuracy.

5184	GreatBay-SCIE	Dienamite: ceasing the destruction of spider mites to revitalize gardens and plantations	Spider mites are notorious pests that destroys worldwide agriculture and horticulture. With abundant progenies and a short life cycle, they develop resistance to chemical pesticides at an exponential rate, making them difficult to exterminate using current strategies. Determined to resolve this global challenge, GreatBay-SCIE thus proposed a thorough solution called Dienamite, which shields plants at multiple stages including pre-, mid-, and post-infection stages. By bio-synthesizing 7-epi-zingiberene, 9-hydroxy-zingiberene, 9-hydroxy-10,11-epoxy zingiberene, mite venom peptide, spider venom peptide, and harpin protein, Dienamite is capable of establishing progeny-reducing effects on spider mites, exterminating adult mites with high target-specificity, and boosting plant immunity simultaneously. Ultimately, we wish to bring prosperity back to gardens and augment agricultural production. We also believe that the emergence of Dienamite can reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, minimizing toxic residues and preserving the environment.

5185	LINKS-China	CuraPack: A Novel Antimicrobial First Aid Kit Developed to Combat Resistant Wound Infections in War	The global rise in wars and natural disasters increased the prevalence of wound infections. Moreover, the misuse of antibiotics and their resistance-prone mechanisms of action led to the spread of resistant pathogens that significantly increased the severity of infections, resulting in amputation or death. Current first aid kits do not possess any means of infection prevention other than resistant-prone antibiotic ointments. However, defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides, possess antimicrobial activity while having lower risks of resistance due to their unique mechanisms of action. This year, we engineered a collection of fusion proteins capable of forming antimicrobial coatings on first aid kit items by attaching domains that could bind to a wide range of first-aid materials to defensins and developing an innovative release mechanism using the SUMO tag. We envision our resistance-free antimicrobial CuraPack to provide protection against infections in diverse scenarios and propagate first aid knowledge throughout the world.

AIS-China introduces Moskilla, an optimized ATSB enhancing attractiveness by incorporating HMBPP-producing E. coli and RNAi-based targeted shRNA mosquitocides. The engineered E. coli overproduces HMBPP through an enhanced MEP pathway and the use of sRNAs to downregulate the expression of downstream enzyme IspH, yielding 0.45 mM HMBPP, while shRNAs, produced in yeast, achieved a 100% mortality rate in mosquitoes within three days. To ensure biosafety, a kill switch using the ?X174-E gene was developed for E. coli, enabling control outside laboratory settings. Moskilla, supported by a hardware device to limit GMOs use, represents an eco-friendly and effective solution for preventing and controlling mosquito-borne diseases, making it a promising innovation for our startup.

Relevant studies have shown that lactic acid has an inhibitory effect on abnormally activated dendritic cells and cytotoxic T-cells in autoimmune diseases, and thus is expected to improve the symptoms of IBD patients. Based on the research, we designed a yeast engineered bacterium. We introduced a muscone detecting switch in the engineered yeast and activated the downstream pathway to express lactate dehydrogenase to produce lactic acid. Ultimately, the engineered bacteria will colonize the small intestine, enabling the patient to treat IBD by inhaling muscone gas in vitro therefore induces the yeast to synthesize a low amount of stabilized lactic acid in vivo.

These women require supplementation with the active form of folic acid. However, the production of active folic acid is hindered by low yields, high costs, and potential food safety concerns. Our project seeks to overcome these challenges by using genetic engineering to develop bacterial strains capable of expressing the enzymes required to convert folate into its active form. This approach has the potential to enable large-scale biological production of active folate.

5193	PuiChing-Macau	Improving quality and quantity of essential oil extraction using engineered E. coli	Essential oils have been used widely in daily life products (such as shampoo and soap). Currently, 93% of essential oils are extracted with steam distillation. While this method does not involve toxic chemicals, the yield of essential oil extraction is very low, usually less than 2% of the plant materials. Previous studies identified enzymes which could break down plant cell walls, increasing yield and preserving the quality of the oils. However, these enzymes are not stable during the boiling-hot steam distillation. We here used various engineered E. coli to produce thermostable enzymes (pectinase and cellulase) which allowed substantial enzyme activities during steam distillation, and significantly improved the yield. In addition, we produced lipases to esterify extracted oils, which enhanced their anti-bacterial properties.

5195	Stanford	Dux. -- Developing Novel Treatment for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy via Competitive Inhibition	Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a rare neuromuscular disorder affecting approximately 1 in 12,000 people, causing progressive and highly variable loss of skeletal muscle, as well as debilitating pain and fatigue. The root cause of FSHD is the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene, which encodes a transcription factor that activates a cascade of hundreds of typically silent target genes. The DUX4 transcription factor comprises two main parts: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and transcriptional activation domain (TAD), which is responsible for activating downstream target genes. Our approach is centered on overexpressing a modified form of the DUX4-DBD lacking the TAD. DUX4-DBD competes for DUX4 binding sites, inhibiting pathogenic DUX4 and stopping downstream gene activation. We are also modulating the components of our engineered protein, exploring the use of fusing a KRAB (Krüppel Associated Box) repressor domain to maximize our therapeutic potential as a suppressor of DUX4-activated genes.

5198	Duke	ATLAS - Antigen Triggered Ligand Amplification System	CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating blood-based cancers, but faces significant challenges in combating solid tumors. ATLAS (Antigen Triggered Ligand Amplification System) is a genetic circuit designed to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in difficult cancers. The system addresses antigen loss, a major challenge where tumors reduce or lose expression of target antigens, that limits CAR-T efficacy. ATLAS combines two synthetic receptors, low-affinity CAR and high-affinity synNotch, to amplify antigen availability at the tumor site. Upon synNotch activation by tumor-specific ligands, the system secretes soluble antigens that stimulate nearby CAR-T cells, creating an activation feedback loop. This process recruits immune cells to the tumor through cytokine release, enhancing the immune response in tumors with diminished antigen expression. By increasing the local concentration of antigens, ATLAS aims to improve CAR-T persistence and effectiveness to treat solid tumors.

We were able to eliminate the use of urea in biocementation and our biosilicification produced less ammonium than microbially induced calcite precipitation while allowing plant germination in biocemented soil. Throughout the project, our team engaged with the community by participating in local science events, consulting with farmers, and receiving insights from a rotorcraft mechanic. Our work has contributed valuable research to genetic engineering and sustainable development.	Biomanufacturing	Gold Medal			2024	Victoria Morrison, Melanie Grogger, J.

5200	SHSD	Transgenic Silkworms Promoting PET Plastic Degradation	In modern society, PET plastic plays an increasingly significant role in our daily lives. Correspondingly, the challenge of effectively degrading PET plastics has drawn the attention of researchers and environmentalists, among other people who concern about the environment. Building on previous research, we created a new silkworm strain by microinjecting recombinant gene expression vectors containing the Fast-PETase and MHETase enzymes, which have been proven to facilitate the degradation of PET plastics. Through further experiments, we demonstrated that the transgenic cocoons secreted by these genetically modified silkworms could effectively degrade PET plastic products. This outcome provides a new solution for biodegradation of PET plastics. Our long-term goal is to achieve industrial-scale production of this new transgenic silk and promote sustainability by enabling the recycling of PET plastics through their degradation byproducts, such as TPA, MHET, and EG, as they are also the raw materials of PET plastics.

5201	HongKong-UCCKE	The Future of Agriculture	Ningxia, China, faces significant agricultural challenges due to high evaporation rates, resulting in crop failures. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach utilizing genetically engineered E. coli to produce hyaluronic acid hydrogels. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring polymer known for its exceptional water-retention properties. By applying hyaluronic acid into the agricultural sector, we aim to create a cost-effective and sustainable solution to combat drought-induced crop losses. Our strategy involves genetically modifying E. coli to express enzymes that are crucial in producing hyaluronic acid. The modified bacteria will produce hyaluronic acid, which can be extracted and used to create hydrogels. These hydrogels will be designed to absorb and retain moisture in the soil, reducing water loss and improving soil hydration levels. The ultimate goal of this project is to assist farmers in drought-prone regions, such as Ningxia, with a practical and affordable tool to enhance crop yields.

5202	Missouri-Miners	MIDAS: Modular Infectious Disease Annihilation System	Craspase, an RNA-activated protease, integrates a Cas enzyme (gRAMP) and the Csx29 protease to target specific proteins upon RNA binding. This project explores utilizing Craspase, delivered via lambda bacteriophages, to neutralize antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria, particularly ampicillin resistance. Specifically, we will employ an engineered fusion protein to modulate Runella bacterial gasdermin protein, inducing cell death through pyroptosis in response to mRNA indicative of ampicillin resistance. With the rising threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, innovative approaches such as bacteriophage therapy are crucial. Our strategy involves modifying a plasmid to express both the Craspase system and the fusion protein anchoring the gasdermin, which will be introduced into ampicillin-resistant E. coli. We aim to monitor bacterial responses on agar plates supplemented with ampicillin. This work aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of phage-mediated delivery of Craspase and fusion proteins in targeting antibiotic resistance, offering a novel approach to combat multidrug-resistant infections and enhance medicine.

5203	NYC-Empire-State	Hydrolink: An Engineered Living Wound Dressing that Targets Infected Wound Sites	As of 2023, over 6.5 million people in the United States alone suffer from chronic wounds. This means that annually, around 40 million people deal with painful, slow healing or recurring wounds that are expensive to treat. With Hydrolink, we aim to engineer Lactobacillus reuteri to be able to detect staph. aureus, the most common wound pathogen, and respond by secreting targeted antimicrobial proteins. This detection is achieved with autoinducing peptide (AIP), which is used by staph. aureus for quorum sensing. After achieving successful transformation, the bacteria can be integrated into a hydrogel material to form a living wound dressing. This method has advantages over alternatives like traditional wound dressings, which must be taken off to check for infection, causing pain and inefficiency. In addition to our wet-lab research, we performed computational modeling and developed a fluorometer to be used with the hydrogel product.

5213	Lund	Methane ReMOOver - Reducing Methane Emissions from Cattle	Cattle release around 80 million tons of methane into the atmosphere annually, significantly contributing to global warming. The methane is produced by methanogens in the cow's rumen as a by-product of enteric fermentation, also resulting in energy loss for the animal. We aim to reduce the methane emissions from cattle by synthetically engineering Cupriavidus necator to produce bromoform, a known methanogenesis inhibitor. The engineered bacteria would ideally colonize the rumen and become a permanent member of the microbiome, continuously inhibiting methane production from within. Our gene insert consists of a bromoperoxidase gene originating from marine bromoform-producing organisms, as well as a hydrogen peroxidase gene to supply the required substrate for bromoperoxidase. While we successfully transformed our simplest construct, only one bromoperoxidase showed protein expression. However, in-vitro co-culturing of C. Necator with methanogens showed decreased methane production, probably due to its competition for the same resources as methanogens.

To address this issue, we propose a three-stage solution utilising the affinity between peptides and microplastics: modeling, expression and deployment. Interaction between shortlisted peptides and microplastic particles were studied using molecular dynamics. The most efficient peptide's sequence was cloned into expression host E.coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant peptides, containing hexa histidine tags bind strongly to Ni-NTA affinity resins. The his-tags aided purification and in deployment. The resin-peptide complex efficiently captures hydrophobic microplastics upon contact.

5230	UToronto	Plasmid.AI: An intelligent platform to write new life	This year at iGEM Toronto, we are developing Plasmid.AI - a platform that uses generative AI to create new, functional DNA sequences. Our ultimate goal is to write entirely new genomes to create novel organisms that have fine-tuned phenotypes. To make headway towards this challenging task, we are starting with the simplest proof of concept - the generation and validation of new plasmid components. To do this, our dry lab team employs sequence-based machine learning approaches to generate novel plasmid sequences. Key plasmid components, such as the origin of replication, are generated and validated in silico. The wet lab team then assesses the viability of these components in vitro - the results of these assays refining dry lab's next iteration of sequences. Concurrently, the hardware team develops high-throughput tools for automated plasmid testing, supported by a comprehensive human practices education campaign and entrepreneurship initiatives to bring AI-driven solutions to market.

5231	PekingHSC	Curmino: Applying unnatural amino acid incorporated CsgA for prodrug click-to-release	Cancer is a major global public health issue. Bacterial therapy has attracted much attention due to its ability to colonize and proliferate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As an amyloid protein, CsgA can be secreted and form fiber structure on the surface of E. coli. By combining Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) technology, we tried to insert the Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA) Tet v2.0 into CsgA. In the principle of click chemistry, prodrug TCO-Dox would site-specific release in the TME, thus effectively killing tumor cells. With the potential to improve efficacy and reduce side effects, this innovative strategy provides new possibilities for cancer treatment.

Even with modern medical technology, there is no cure for the disease, and the purpose of treatments is only to slow its progression. Late detection renders treatment delay, leading to a decline in QOV (Quality of Vision) with symptoms such as blurred decreasing vision, and even blindness. POIROT is aimed to detect glaucoma biomarker miRNA easily at home. We adopted a protein-based cell-free system to achieve rapid social implementation. The series of reactions proceeds isothermally, and test results can be visually determined by color changes, with useability emphasized. Furthermore, POIROT has potential applications for other diseases, as it can efficiently quantify disease-specific (tiny amounts) nucleic acids in body fluids.

We address this profound gap by introducing PICasSO, a toolbox for rationally engineering the 3D genome organization. Using different CRISPR/Cas orthologs and new, engineered fusion guide RNAs, we created ""Cas staples"" that bind and connect otherwise non-interacting genomic regions. To streamline the development cycle of new Cas staples, we developed DaVinci, a multi-faceted model integrating both local and long-range DNA-protein interactions into a unified pipeline. Combining PICasSO and DaVinci, we recapitulated mechanistic core principles of enhancer hijacking - a driver of tumor development.

We engineered Lactobacillus plantarum L168 to produce inosine by incorporating the key enzyme gsk. The engineered probiotics release inosine in the gut, which then travels through the bloodstream to the brain, disconnecting SERT from nNOS to alleviate depressive symptoms. Regarding Alzheimer's disease?we identified tetrahydrofolate as an effective LilrB3 binder and produce it using the key enzyme sequence folKE. Tetrahydrofolate binds to LilrB3 receptor, preventing APOE4 interaction and inhibiting A? deposition. Accordingly, we genetically engineered Lactobacillus plantarum L168 to biosynthesize theanine and niacin, aiming to develop therapy for Alzheimer's disease and depressions, respectively. Our aim is to assist patients suffering from depression and Alzheimer's Disease in reclaiming their cognitive functions and emotional well-being.

5239	Sustech-Med	The treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm based on CBASS system engineering	Cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) is a type of anti-phage defense system that is homologous to the animal cGAS-STING innate immune pathway. The CBASS system consists of two parts: oligonucleotide cyclase and effector. During phage infection, oligonucleotide cyclase produces signal cyclic oligonucleotides, and the effector is activated by the cyclic oligonucleotide, which causes cell death through membrane damage, DNA degradation, and other means. We use a variety of methods such as the type IV secretion system to introduce the CBASS system into the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm through plasmid transformation, and use virulent phages for infection to achieve the purpose of treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The project verified for the first time that the CBASS system can assist phages in the treatment of biofilms, and its significance lies in providing the world with strategies for biofilm-related infectious diseases.

5240	DNHS-SanDiego-CA	FluoroFind	Currently, advancements in synthetic biology are often limited by the lack of biosensors. Recently, a paper presented a library of ~2000 E. coli promoters fused to GFP. The goal of this project was to test 10 different molecules with each promoter as a starting point for biosensor development. First, we screened each molecule-promoter pair to identify which ones produced the highest fluorescence. Then, the top few promoters for each molecule were titrated under increasing concentrations of their respective molecule. Due to inconsistencies in the data, we created fresh strains, made uncontaminated media, corrected mislabeled promoters, and regrew promoters with low cell growth. A Deep Learning model was created to predict whether any promoter-molecule pair would produce significant fluorescence in the initial screen. Prominent strains were also analyzed with molecular docking and used to create theoretical parts for future experimentation. In general, this research makes important contributions to biosensor development.

Our solution is designed to achieve three tasks: first, it detects the explosives and signals their presence; second, it breaks down these explosives into non-explosive derivatives; and third, it confirms the UXO is safe. To deploy this system safely and efficiently, we have built an aerial bio-drone capable of dispersing our bacterial solution over contaminated areas. This provides a scalable, cost-effective, and risk-free method for clearing UXOs. We believe that our approach has the potential to revolutionize the demining process, offering hope to communities still living under the threat of landmines and UXOs."

5253	SDU-Denmark	Endometriosis treatment by inducing apoptosis in endometriotic tissue with a designed treatment plasmid.	We aim to develop a minimally invasive, non-hormonal treatment for endometriosis by using a plasmid to induce apoptosis in endometriotic tissue while sparing healthy endometrial cells. Studies show that estrogen receptor ? (ER?) is upregulated >100-fold in endometriotic cells, while estrogen receptor ? (ER?) is downregulated. Both are regulated by estrogen. We aim to create conditions where increased ER? and decreased ER? expression activate the ER? promoter, leading to BAX gene transcription from the plasmid. BAX is a protein involved in apoptosis, and its increased expression should induce cell death in endometriotic cells. In healthy cells, where ER? is upregulated and ER? is downregulated, BCL2 gene transcription is promoted by the ER? promoter, helping protect healthy cells from apoptosis. This approach aims for selective treatment of endometriotic tissue without harming normal cells.

5258	ULC	Application of SBD in drug resistance TB diagnosis	Currently, around 2 percent of deaths are caused by tuberculosis, especially those possessing drug resistance. Efficient identification of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is urgently required for a fast and scientific treatment. The prevalent polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the chief method used in drug-resistance testing, relies on high-cost equipment and lacks sample point-of-care testing (POCT). Along the research work of Deng Academician's group, our team utilized the sulfur binding domain (SBD) technique to develop a new POCT tool. This protein category embeds sulfur into its hydrophobic cavity and recognizes phosphorothioate DNA(PT-DNA) by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between the SBD and the DNA. Our project aspires to test SBD's binding capacity to select target-oriented proteins. In the future, these proteins will act as the main ingredient for one detection kit for drug-resistant tuberculosis and contribute to better and timely treatment for patients.

Caddisfly silk is a wet adhesive secreted by aquatic caddisfly larvae to protect against the elements, and thus boasts a high tensile strength, biodegradability and non-cytotoxic properties. Our team hopes to develop a yeast strain capable of expressing caddisfly silk for purification and mass production into Caddisgraft surgical meshes. This yeast strain would be created through a novel synthesis method that stitches together highly repetitive silk protein motifs until the desired number of repeats is reached. Ultimately, Caddisgraft hopes to reduce post-operative pain and encourage better tissue regrowth in cosmetic surgery patients.

A primary objective of synthetic biology is the application of electronic engineering principles to cellular and biomolecular systems. By manipulating different genetic circuit modules, cells can be engineered to perform specific tasks akin to digital devices. Integrating PLDs into cellular systems opens the possibility of programming cells to exhibit reliable, robust, and diverse behaviors. Existing powerful tools in biology, such as recombinases--a robust recombination framework--and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), an effective NOT gate widely used in gene circuit design, facilitate this endeavor.

Existing solutions often lack scalability or interfere with coral physiology. We, offers an innovative synthetic biology approach to enhance coral resilience. We engineer the symbiotic bacteria Endozoicomonas to express a light-shielding chromoprotein in response to environmental stressors. This protein reduces excessive light reaching zooxanthellae, the photosynthetic algae within corals, thereby mitigating oxidative damage without disrupting essential cellular functions. By incorporating a regulated genetic circuit sensitive to heat and light, we ensure the chromoprotein is produced only under stress conditions, preserving normal coral and bacterial activity otherwise. This strategy mimics the natural protective effects observed in turbid waters, where reduced light intensity lessens bleaching events. Our solution aims for sustainable, long-term integration into coral ecosystems, offering a scalable method to combat coral bleaching induced by both high temperatures and intense light.

As the concentration of cholate in the intestine increases after meals, the GroESL promoter initiates transcription and promotes the secretion of fusion proteins by the engineered bacteria. The LMWP facilitates the entry of FGF21 into the bloodstream, and FGF21 improves tissue insulin resistance. (2)Constitutive expression system that displays Akkermansia muciniphila P9 protein on the membrane. P9 protein binds to the ICAM-2 receptor on intestinal epithelial L-cells, releasing GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which promotes insulin secretion. We hope that our engineered intestinal Lactobacillus can provide a novel approach for the long-term relief of T2DM by coordinating and leveraging the body's glucose-lowering mechanisms in a non-invasive, long-lasting, and more humane way, thus aiding in the alleviation, control, or even cure of diabetes.

5286	TUM-Straubing	Bluebear Bio - Making Cell-Free Expression Systems Accessible	Cell-free transcription and translation (TXTL) is a powerful tool that enables biomolecule production directly from DNA, bypassing the need for living cells. This allows for faster prototyping and production. Our project builds on recent TXTL advancements by using a genetically modified E. coli BL21(DE3) autolysate strain, featuring tardigrade protein genes CAHS 107838, CAHS 106094, and CAHS 94063. These proteins enhance lysate stability at higher temperatures, eliminating the need for costly cryogenic storage. Additionally, we optimized the energy buffer to lower costs, making expensive equipment unnecessary. This opens up TXTL technology to broader use, especially in resource-limited settings. Our improved system is also ideal for educational purposes, as it reduces the financial burden of maintaining specialized lab infrastructure. These advancements make cell-free systems more affordable and accessible, driving further innovation in synthetic biology across academic, industrial, and low-resource environments.

5302	USTC	VEBATIN-Engineering bacteria to inhibit solid tumor proliferation by competing VEGF	One of the major challenges in the treatment of solid tumors arises from the immunosuppressive nature of the surrounding tumor microenvironment?TME?, which weakens the immune system's cytotoxic ability. Currently, therapeutic strategies targeting the solid tumor microenvironment have gained extensive attention, while most existing treatments still confront with challenges such as off-target risks. Our team has noticed that harmless Escherichia coli Nissle 1917(EcN) can automatically colonize the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating excellent targeting potential. Therefore, we plan to utilize the angiogenesis mechanism driven by vascular endothelial growth factorin ?VEGF?in the human body. We plan to genetically modified EcN to express VEGF competitive binding receptors under ideal conditions of TME and conduct a surface display in ECN. By integrating and consuming VEGF in the tumor microenvironment, we plan to reduce its concentration in the TME, thereby effectively inhibiting angiogenesis in tumor areas and ultimately suppress tumor proliferation.

5314	OUC-Haide	BEST-ABfree: Efficient synthesis of ?-glucan to reduce antibiotic utilization	Livestock farming has long been essential for providing high-quality protein and other animal by-products. Antibiotics are extensively used in this industry to ensure stable production. However, misuse of antibiotics leads to environmental residues and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant superbugs, posing significant human health risks. ?-glucans, naturally occurring ?-D-glucose polysaccharides found in grains, bacteria, and fungi, offer a potential alternative to antibiotics due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory. ?-glucans, particularly from Aureobasidium melanogenum BZ-11, can be efficiently produced via fermentation. This fungus isolated from mangroves secretes extracellular polysaccharides, including ?-glucans, but also melanin and pullulan, which complicate the purification process. Using synthetic biology techniques, we employed Cre-loxP to block the secretion of melanin and pullulan, enhancing the purity of ?-glucans. Additionally, introducing an oxygen uptake system improved yield. Our optimized fermentation process allows for the efficient production of ?-glucans, presenting a viable antibiotic alternative for livestock feed, potentially mitigating antibiotic misuse.

""Thrombosis"" is a general term for diseases caused by blood clots obstructing blood vessels, including myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and cardioembolic stroke. This is a significant issue in Japan, which is experiencing an aging society. Among the G7 countries, Japan has the highest percentage of elderly people within its total population. However, current treatments for Thrombosis consist of side effects that heavily affect the body. which is why we decided to use nattokinase, which is found in the Japanese traditional food, ""Natto"". Nattokinase demonstrates strong thrombolytic activity by enhancing the effects of the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin present in the body, therefore easy to consume the body, less resistant from consumers, and is a new preventative solution for Thrombosis.

This overexpression is achieved through the infection of NPCs with an AAV vector. Donor's NPCs are kept in a reservoir and infected after stroke takes place, then transplanted into the patient's damaged brain region to enhance regeneration, improving integration, synapsis and minimizing tissue death. During our investigation, the need for precise monitoring led to the development of a customizable reporter transfection cassette, which can be easily removed during the humanization of the vector. This study concluded that BDNF can be overexpressed in human NPCs for over 50 days. We observed that an increase in BDNF levels correlates with a higher neural activity, better axon connectivity and higher cell count, without generating aberrant networks."

5323	CUG-China	Genetically engineering Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans for effective biomining	Given the global increasing demand for mineral resources and the ore grades decline, there is an increasing utilization of microorganisms in biomining to extract valuable metals from low-grade ores and electronic waste. Biomining offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional mineral processing technologies. However, it faces challenges like long leaching cycles, low extraction efficiency, and unspecific bioleaching. The genetic engineering of microorganisms can enhance their capabilities for improved biomining performance promisingly. Acidithiobacillus, a genus of extremophilic acidophiles commonly inhabiting mining process waters and acid mine drainage, is a promising chassis for metal recovery and bioremediation of metal-contaminated sites. In 2024, CUG-China aims to enhance biomining efficiency for nonferrous metals by genetically engineering Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.

The disease is caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which infects bats during their hibernation period, causing the collagen in their noses to slowly degrade due to proteolytic enzymes produced by the fungus. This causes the bats to become active from hibernation prematurely, which results in lethargy due to the limited resources. Without the necessary means to sustain life available in the winter season, death is often a result. There is currently no widespread treatment to prevent P. destructans infections in bats. We aim to engineer E. coli that secrete a serine protease inhibitor(s) to prevent collagen degradation.

To address PLA's environmental persistence, we are working to engineer the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to degrade PLA and generate power from its breakdown. S. oneidensis is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobe capable of extracellular electron transfer, and can break down organic material and generate electricity in microbial fuel cells. It utilizes lactic acid as its carbon source to produce electricity. Therefore, we engineered S. oneidensis with genes encoding for PLA depolymerases from 4 bacterial strains. When expressing these genes, we expect that S. oneidensis will be capable of depolymerizing PLA to lactic acid, then using the lactic acid as a substrate for electricity production. The S. oneidensis strains that were successful in degrading PLA will be used in a microbial fuel cell for electricity production with PLA as the carbon source.

MAP2121c is a novel Type 2A Encapsulin that readily forms multimeric cages to protect a cysteine desulfurase from environmental oxidative stress. Exploiting this cage formation, we fused encapsulin monomers to two parts of a split-luciferase to develop our bioluminescent test. Cage formation between the two luciferase-linked encapsulins allows the luciferase to form and upon the addition of the substrate, a bioluminescent signal would be observed, indicating a negative result for Johne's disease. The introduction of wild-type encapsulin from an infected bovine blood sample would disrupt split-luciferase binding and reduce the bioluminescence, yielding a positive test result for Johne's disease. Our light detection kit is intended to be used to detect the bioluminescence on-site, with potential for farmers to use in the future.

Continuous cortisol measurements can give important insights to imbalances in this hormone signalling, for example in Addison's disease or stress. While many approaches are being investigated, no final continuous wearable cortisol measuring device is publicly available yet. In this project a molecular mechanism around the use of the glucocorticoid receptor that binds cortisol specifically is being developed. In the future the basic molecular mechanism for cortisol ligand binding measurements could be done by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Here the receptor is attached to a gold electrode and changes conformation upon ligand binding, which changes the resistivity of the electrode and therefore electric signal. This concept is then implemented into a small wearable device that resembles a glucose monitoring device worn by diabetes patients to go with a publicly already established design.

Using Bacillus subtilis, we employ virus-like particles conjugated with immune-activating proteins through spontaneous covalent coupling. They can widely distribute from the plant's roots to the phyllosphere, serving to activate the plant's own immune response induction. Bacillus velezensis can detect changes in the level of phytohormones (salicylic acid) produced by plants in response to nematode damage. Upon sensing the signaling stimulation, the engineered bacteria are capable of producing antinematodal proteins, trans-aconitic acid, and antisense RNAs targeting important genes in nematode's life cycle, attacking nematodes from multiple aspects.

5338	Westview-SanDiego	Using thermostable and active Fast PETase enzyme to degrade PET plastics in simulated marine environment	Due to the influx of microplastic pollution in water systems, the abundance of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics in the oceans causes issues for both marine and terrestrial life. The enzymes, PETase and MHETase, found in the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, have shown degradation of PET plastics. However, because I. sakaiensis is found mainly in soil, it is not an ideal host when attempting to degrade PET plastics in the ocean. By introducing Fast PETase (a more thermostable and active form of PETase) and MHETase into Alteromonas macleodii, a marine bacterium, there is the possibility of degradation of PET in saltwater conditions. Using the Loop Assembly method, plasmids were constructed with FastPETase and MHETase into E. coli, and conjugated into A. macleodii. Ongoing experiments comparing Fast PETase and PETase will demonstrate the possibility for a more efficient plastic degradation reaction, with degradation measured through concentration of hydroxyl groups in FTIR Analysis.

5346	IISc-Software	IMPROViSeD : Integrated Modelling of Protein Complexes Via Single-shot registration using DREAM	The exploration of protein-protein interactions and their implications in cellular functions is pivotal for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This project introduces IMPROVISeD, an advanced platform designed for the modeling of protein complexes. We create models in one shot by directly incorporating geometric constraints from extracted experimental data to orientate the structure of the subunits (proteins) forming the complex. The approach uses significantly less time compared to contemporary algorithms that employ sampling-based approaches. The approach was tested for both synthetically - and experimentally-derived constraint data. The method is permissive to missing and ambiguous constraint data. The underlying nonlinear optimization formulations, including one-shot registration, make IMPROViSeD's approach computationally efficient, robust, and scalable. The availability of modelled complexes provides key insights into the structure, function, and interactions of subunits and establishes a solid framework for designing targeted therapies. The tool can also be leveraged for modelling heterogeneous macromolecular complexes.

5348	Songshan-Lake	Smart Algicidal Bacteria to Control Water Blooms	Eutrophication of water bodies can lead to cyanobacterial blooms, which cause serious harm to water ecosystems and the safety of drinking water. Algicidal bacteria (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) is a kind of bacteria that can directly or indirectly kill algal cells or inhibit their growth. Although algicidal bacteria can inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria and solve the problem of water blooms, the overgrowth and proliferation of any kind of microorganisms may hurt the natural environment. This project aims to develop and design a controllable ‘smart algicide bacteria' that can inhibit the spread of bloom and also regulate the growth of algicide bacteria to prevent secondary pollution to the environment. We hope to provide an efficient and safe solution to the cyanobacterial problem and demonstrate the potential of synthetic biology applications in environmental governance, opening up new possibilities for future ecological protection and resource management.

5351	FDfzSH	Rational Construction of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Strain for Utilization of Xylose	Fuel ethanol, with its high octane number and clean combustion, is a promising biofuel alternative to petrochemical energy. A sustainable approach involves cellulosic ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, known for its tough texture and complex structure. After pretreatment, it releases both glucose and xylose, but wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a key strain for ethanol production, cannot naturally utilize xylose. Enhancing its ability to metabolize xylose requires introducing metabolic pathways for xylose isomerization, often achieved through laboratory adaptive evolution, which can be time-consuming and may lead to unstable strain phenotypes. This study aimed to overcome these limitations by reconstructing the xylose utilization pathway in S. cerevisiae. We identified the NFS1I492N gene mutation and integrated the multi-copy xylA gene, which encodes xylose isomerase, to enable efficient xylose metabolism. This approach seeks to develop more robust S. cerevisiae strains capable of efficiently converting xylose into ethanol, contributing to more sustainable biofuel production.

After successfully expressing the channel proteins, we used the lamp2b protein to package the them, also synthesized using synthetic biology, into vesicles (EVs) using exocytosis. We then allowed the vesicles to fuse with the target cell. Finally, we induced the calcium ion channels on the cancer cell membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (RyR) in the cancer cells to open under the combined action of ultrasound and hNOS2, significantly increasing the intracellular calcium influx and releasing the calcium the endoplasmic reticulum. This triggered calcium overload in cancer cells, leading to cell death and achieving an anti-cancer effect.

Traditional detection only monitors single endocrine disruption effects, neglecting the combined toxicological effects within organisms. We aim to assess these complex effects using a microbial sensor based on multiple logic gates. We've developed a hormone-sensitive intein to detect endocrine disruption and used the recA element from the SOS response to identify oxidative damage. An AND gate detection circuit with HRP regulation network enables the simultaneous detection of both effects. Additionally, we've designed a high-throughput, automated, portable fluorescence detection platform for our biosensor.

5374	TestDaily-I-Beijing	Enhancing Bone Repair: Solving the Burst Release Problem in Regenerative Materials with Fusion-Expressed Cell Factors	Bone injuries, scoliosis, and bone defects are major health issues in China, caused by trauma, infections, tumors, or congenital diseases, causing functional impairment and pain. Current treatments like autografts, allografts, and artificial bone materials have limitations. Autografts are limited by donor availability and need extra surgery. Allografts risk rejection and infection. Artificial bone materials lack biocompatibility and bioactive components. Our study aims to develop a dual-cell factor(VEGF&BMP-4) release system with collagen-binding properties, addressing the limitations of artificial bone materials, to ensure safe and rapid bone formation, reducing risks of oncogenesis and ectopic ossification. The innovative dual-cell factor release design allows for the enhancement of repair efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with non-sequential release, to offer a far more efficient and safer bone repair solution. The proposed system illustrates significant potential for broad clinical applications, by elevating and refining the treatment of bone defects and associated conditions.

5380	BYU-Provo	Soil-IQ: An In-plant Soil Nitrate Indicator for Producers in the Developing World	Farmers in the developing world currently lack affordable, intuitive systems for optimizing fertilizer use. As a result, many under or overfertilize, harming their yields, and damaging the environment. Many sustainable development practices make farmers feel like they have to choose between their livelihoods and the environment, leading to decreased results of efforts to alleviate poverty or to protect the environment. Soil-IQ utilizes a novel nitrate detecting promoter and an intuitive colorimetric reporter to help farmers know when they have fertilized enough to maximize their yields without harming the environment. Designed for farmers and by farmers, Soil-IQ removes the guesswork in fertilizer optimization and helps farmers be both sustainable and more productive. As a result, Soil-IQ helps protect those at most risk from climate change and environmental degradation while simultaneously enabling them to create more resilient and efficient farms, making sustainable development a win-win for both farmers and other stakeholders.

Through the iGEM engineering cycle and our engineering success, we were also able to refine the expression of T7RNAP to stable levels through the addition of regulatory elements such as antisense oligonucleotides to knockdown the expression of T7 RNAP. With this compatible expression and reporter system, our project aims to generate a diverse library of RNAP variants using different methods such as site-directed mutagenesis, ancestral reconstruction, and random mutagenesis. These variants will then be screened using our reporter system to identify for better-performing variants.

5403	TU-Eindhoven	PROMISE: Precision Oncology - Modular Immunotherapy using Surface-Engineered bacterial membrane vesicles	Immunotherapies offer great potential for treating immune-mediated diseases, but often lead to resistance and adverse effects. To address this, iGEM TU Eindhoven is developing PROMISE, a novel trained immunity vaccine utilizing antigen-functionalized bacterial membrane vesicles (BMVs). Building on the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, PROMISE reprograms innate immune cells for a stronger, broader immune response, overcoming immune evasion and providing long-lasting protection. Unlike the live bacteria in the BCG vaccine, our BMVs are safe for systemic use because they cannot replicate. By functionalizing BMVs with disease-specific antigens, PROMISE also activates adaptive immune responses, ensuring a targeted and durable therapeutic effect. Initially focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the platform's modular design allows for adaptation to other diseases. Advanced computational modeling tools identify highly immunogenic, patient-specific antigens, enabling personalized vaccines. Supported by expert collaborations and protected by a provisional patent, PROMISE has a clear path toward clinical translation and further development.

5405	Pisa-IT	Using Bacillus subtilis as a DNA-Based Biosensor for the Grape Vine Pathogen Plasmopara viticola	Plasmopara viticola, commonly known as downy mildew or Peronospora in Italian, is one of the most destructive pathogens affecting grapevines. Current methods for managing this pathogen rely heavily on the repetitive use of chemical pesticides, which pose significant risks to both the environment and human health in vineyard regions. In this study, we explore the use of genetically modified Bacillus subtilis as a DNA-based biosensor for the early detection of Plasmopara viticola, allowing for proactive disease management before grapevine infection occurs. To prevent direct contact between the modified bacteria and plants, a specialized device was developed to house the biosensors. Additionally, a fiber-optic system incorporating a sol-gel matrix was used to enhance the detection signal, addressing the challenges of signal transmission typically encountered in bioreactor systems. This innovative approach offers a sustainable alternative to current pesticide-dependent strategies, with potential applications in precision viticulture.

5414	SEHS	Illuminating the brain: Discovery of cyclic N-aminoluciferins (cyL) for brain tumor bioluminescence imaging	Brain tumors can cause neurological impairments and death, stressing the necessity for ongoing research and enhanced therapies. Bioluminescence imaging, a non-invasive imaging technique, is employed in tumor research, gene expression, drug screening, and other fields. However, substrates like D-luciferin and aminoluciferin have short red-light emission (tissue-penetrating), insufficient in vivo bioluminescence duration, and inadequate blood-brain barrier permeability, resulting in bioluminescence imaging for brain tumors challenging. This study develops cyclic N-aminoluciferins (cyL) as firefly luciferase substrates with improved bioluminescence via rational design and organic synthesis. Due to its red-shifted bioluminescent emission, prolonged bioluminescence duration and enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration, 7-cyL is a promising candidate for bioluminescence imaging of brain tumors after biological evaluations. In summary, our approach allows direct brain tumor progression imaging and fills a long-standing gap in real animal imaging. We believe that these cyL compounds will improve bioluminescence imaging and help us understand brain tumor growth and treatment.

5428	USP-Brazil	Glyco-insideout: A new approach of protein glycosylation	Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive sphingolipidosis caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, leading to a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme breaks down glucosylceramide into ceramide and glucose, and its deficiency results in the accumulation of glucosylceramide in macrophages, forming Gaucher cells. These cells can infiltrate organs like the bone marrow, liver, and spleen, causing anemia, bone destruction, and other dysfunctions. Treatment involves enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase, velaglucerase, or taliglucerase, but production is costly and limited due to the complex glycosylation process in animal or plant cells. The project proposes bioengineering microorganisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, to produce N-glycosylated proteins, including ?-glucocerebrosidase, as a proof of concept to evaluate glycosylation efficiency and therapeutic potential. This approach could reduce costs and increase access to treatment by enabling microorganisms to transfer the human-like Man3GlcNac2 polysaccharide, improving large-scale production of therapeutic enzymes.

"Our island home, the tropical country of Taiwan, is seasonally plagued by insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, flies, and mites. During the hot and humid summer months, mosquitoes and other insects breed in abundance, causing anything from minor itches to infectious diseases. Conventional active ingredients in insect-repellents such as DEET, while effective and cheap, have an unpleasant odor, cause allergies, and aren't environmentally friendly. As a country with an increasingly vibrant lifestyle, we also noticed the ever-rising popularity of fragrances. Our project, BOROHMA, combines insect-repellency and great aroma to create a customizable insect-repellent fragrance; we do so by biosynthesizing L-borneol, a pleasant-smelling and insect-repelling camphor derivative, and encapsulating it into specially engineered bacterial minicell to create a safe borneol-release system. This system is then mixed with different ingredients to craft smells that people love. By using borneol, we also honor our country's booming camphor industry in the early 20th century."

5439	TecMonterreyGDL	AQUASENS - FRET Biosensor for Emerging Contaminants	By 2050, the global population will grow by 2 billion, increasing pressure on freshwater resources. Currently, agriculture consumes 92% of the world's water, jeopardizing food systems due to rising competition. Wastewater reuse becomes critical, but 80% is not properly treated, and 11% of crops, especially in the Global South, rely on it. In Mexico, only 5.4% of wastewater is reused, with limited research on emerging contaminants. To tackle this issue, we present Aquasens, a portable system that efficiently detects water contaminants using FRET technology. It features a biosensor that identifies changes in fluorescence when contaminants are detected in a sample. In this project, we present lab results using a FRET system to detect rifampicin, cadmium, and ibuprofen, along with a new version of the device from the previous team. We also conducted social activities to raise awareness about Jalisco's water situation and developed a business plan for future commercialization.

5443	MacquarieUni	Aroma Alchemists: Optimising vanillin biosynthesis in E.coli	"Vanillin is an aromatic aldehyde used in food, beverage and cosmetics applications. Worldwide consumption exceeds 16,000 tons annually, with 0.25% from natural extraction from vanilla orchid pods, and the remainder from organic chemical synthesis. The biotechnological production of vanillin offers a promising alternative. In this project, we design and test four different biosynthesis gene clusters to manufacture vanillin from tyrosine in bacteria, using a cumate-inducible control system and a low-copy number broad-host-range plasmid; preliminary LC-MS data indicate that we were successful in making small amounts of vanillin, and that the caffeate-> ferulate reaction (COMT) was rate-limiting in our system. Further evidence for functional expression of the HpaBC monooxygenase was seen from production of a brown melanin-type dye as a side-reaction; we believe this indicates that HpaBC is acting on tyrosine (to make L-DOPA, which polymerises) in addition to the intended reaction on 4-coumarate to make caffeate."

5449	WHHS-Pro-China	Engineered Bacteria for Efficient Phosphate Adsorption and Recovery	This study focuses on developing an engineered phosphate recovery system using two bacterial strains. The first system, PhosLock 1.0, utilizes ice nucleation protein (INP) to anchor phosphate-binding proteins (PBP) on the cell surface, allowing efficient phosphate adsorption. The second system, PhosRegen 2.0, optimizes PBP secretion using the PelB signal peptide, which guides PBP into the extracellular medium. Both systems were experimentally validated for phosphate adsorption and desorption under varying pH and temperature conditions. PhosLock 1.0 demonstrated efficient phosphate binding, but faced challenges with bacterial stability. PhosRegen 2.0 addressed these limitations by coupling PBP with NHS-activated beads, improving both adsorption and desorption efficiency. This dual approach offers a promising solution for wastewater phosphate recovery and lays the foundation for scalable, sustainable environmental remediation technologies.

5452	USP-EEL-Brazil	CBDynamics: Optimization of the Synthetic Production of Cannabidiol	In recent years, cannabidiol (CBD) has gained significant recognition in the medical field as a key component as an adjuvant in treatments for various conditions, including psychotherapeutic therapies. However, in Brazil, the cultivation and commercialization of Cannabis sativa, the plant source of CBD, face strict legal restrictions. This project proposes an alternative method to produce CBD using synthetic biology, bypassing the need for the plant. The plan involves synthesizing cannabidiol through recombinant gene technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), which will express cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), a precursor of CBD. The process utilizes two metabolic pathways: the geranyl diphosphate (GPP) pathway and the olivetolic acid pathway. These precursors are combined in enzymatic reactions to form cannabigerolic acid, which is then converted into CBDA. The CBDA can be purified and transformed into CBD, offering a more efficient production method without the legal complications of Cannabis cultivation.

The AflaxOFF project addresses this issue by engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae to act as a biosensor, providing early detection of AFB1 contamination in food, as well as a probiotic, preventing AFB1 absorption in the intestines, thereby protecting both humans and animals from the toxin. AflaxOFF actively engages with stakeholders, including farmers and food industry professionals, to ensure that the technology meets real-world needs and fosters community awareness about AFB1 risks.

Although traditional chemical fungicides can effectively resist sheath blight, they also bring a series of environmental and other problems. Spraying double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to induce gene silencing (SIGS) is a potential new tool for sustainable and environmentally friendly plant disease control. This project designed a sequence that can target and silence pathogenicity-related genes, RsCAT (R. solani catalase), constructed it into an expression vector, and used E. coli HT115(DE3) to produce dsRNA. Experiments have shown that after spraying RsCAT-dsRNA, the transcription level of the RsCAT gene was downregulated, and corn showed obvious disease resistance. In summary, Our project not only provides a novel strategy for the management of corn sheath blight but also carries significant potential for broad-spectrum application in the control of a variety of crop diseases.

Breastmilk can be contaminated with endocrine disrupting contaminants (EDCs) like BPA, PCBs, and dioxins. These harmful compounds can accumulate in breastmilk and pose a risk to infants. Without proper disposal, these toxins can cause long-term health issues. Inspired by the liver, we present SUPERMOM, a yeast-based contaminant-induced system that detects and detoxifies harmful EDCs in breastmilk. SUPERMOM uses biosensors and phase I and phase II liver detoxifying enzymes to keep breastmilk safe for infants. We envision SUPERMOM to be integrated into everyday breastfeeding products, such as milk bottles or nipple shields, through a dual-layer encapsulation system. This system ensures that while breastmilk interacts with SUPERMOM, the yeast remains securely contained, offering parents a safe and effective way to detect and detoxify contaminated breastmilk.

5478	CSW-UD	Increasing the Thermostability of RuBisCO Activase for Increased Crop Yield	As global temperatures increase, human populations rise, and food insecurity worsens, there is a need for immediate action to sustain humanity. Scientists aim to increase crop yield to battle the current circumstances, focusing on improving RuBisCO, a key enzyme in photosynthesis. However, they often overlook RuBisCO's chaperone RuBisCo activase (RCA) which creates thermal limitations. The activase regulates the activity of RuBisCO by removing inhibitory sugar phosphates, RuBP, from RuBisCO's active sites to maintain RuBisCO's catalytically active form. While RuBisCO is thermostable at temperatures above the optimal carbon dioxide assimilation rate, RCA is highly heat-sensitive, so our project aims to enhance RCA's heat resistance. To detect the heat-sensitive regions of RCA, we used machine learning (MutCompute) and implemented point mutations in those regions. Though we were unable to use our assays due to time constraints, our research serves as a strong foundation for further study on this topic.

5490	IOANNINA	A CRISPR-Cas13d Antiviral System Targeting West Nile Virus-Induced Encephalitis via NFAT-Regulated Gene Expression	West Nile Virus (WNV) is a neuroinvasive pathogen responsible for severe encephalitis,with no specific antiviral treatment currently available. In this study, we propose an innovative antiviral strategy utilizing the RNA-targeting Cas13d system to combat WNV-induced encephalitis. Our approach involves designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) through a custom algorithm, tailored to efficiently target WNV RNA sequences. To enhance the safety and specificity of the Cas13d system, we integrate a regulatory mechanism involving a synthetic NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells). This engineered NFAT ensures that Cas13d expression is induced only upon viral infection, levaraging the calcium influx triggered by WNV entry, which activates endogenous NFAT signaling. By linking the antiviral response to WNV-specific cellular changes, this system minimizes off-target effects and reduces the risk of unintended immune activation. This regulated antiviral platform holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach for treating WNV-induced neurological disroders.

Importantly, hsp-90 was revealed as a putative target for WGX-50 using molecular dynamics simulations. Four novel hits, namely F44E5.4/.5, sri-40, F59B2.12, K09C6.9 revealed by RNA sequencing, were first tested to be irrelevant to the lifespan extension effect of WGX-50 through RNA interference. Thus, our results offer primary insights on the medicinal application of WGX-50 in long-term and anti-aging healthcare.

5501	WLSA-ShanghaiAcademy	The Power of Nature: Pioneering a New Approach to Diabetes Treatment with Isoorientin	Diabetes mellitus is a global health issue. Isoorientin, a plant-derived compound, has shown potential in managing diabetes by promoting insulin secretion and improving insulin sensitivity. However, its low natural concentration limits large-scale production, highlighting the urgent need for alternative biosynthesis methods. To address this challenge, our study focuses on the biosynthesis of isoorientin by engineering E. coli to express the C-glycosyltransferase Gt6CGT. The Gt6CGT gene was initially cloned into the pET-21a(+) expression vector, and a recombinant plasmid was constructed using seamless cloning technology. This plasmid was subsequently transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) competent cells, where protein expression was induced by IPTG. After expression, the enzymatic activity of Gt6CGT was confirmed through microplate reader and HPLC analysis. This system provides a robust foundation for the efficient biosynthesis of isoorientin and supports its potential large-scale production as a natural therapeutic for diabetes.

5502	Institut-Le-Rosey	Inexpensive EGFR Mutation Detection Kit for Early Diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of cases. Current detection methods are either invasive or costly, limiting accessibility. Our project aims to develop an affordable, non-invasive diagnostic kit for early detection of NSCLC by targeting EGFR mutations, a key biomarker. Using padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) coupled with a split lettuce probe detection mechanism, the kit amplifies and identifies the mutated sequence in cell-free DNA from patient blood samples. This process eliminates the need for expensive PCR equipment, making the test accessible in low-resource settings. The fluorescent signal generated by the lettuce probe binding to the amplified product indicates the presence of the mutation. By providing a preliminary diagnosis, this kit can help identify high-risk individuals earlier, increasing the chances of timely treatment before the cancer advances to critical stages.

Over the years, China has actively fulfilled its commitments under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and has made notable progress. However, the global rate of desertification remains alarming, severely threatening ecological security and sustainable development. As a group of high school students committed to a responsible future, we have engineered Komagataeibacter xylinus to produce bacterial cellulose (BC) more efficiently. BC possesses exceptional water-retention properties, is environmentally friendly, and does not hinder the growth and development of tree roots, making it an ideal candidate as a water-retaining matrix material for afforestation in deserts. By enriching BC around the roots of tree, we aim to enhance the drought tolerance and survival rate of newly transplanted trees, thereby contributing to the mitigation of land desertification.

Currently, a series of immune checkpoint inhibitors have gained clinical acceptance to improve the immunosuppressive environment within the tumor and enhance the anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T lymphocytes. And synthetic biology serves as a possible approach to enable the coordinated release of defective cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to be able to produce similar immunomodulatory effects. Targeting the OSCC tumor microenvironment to achieve barrier clearance and immune enhancement through specific components or structures in the TME that induce tumor immunosuppression has aroused our interest. Through studying the literature and communicating with expert predecessors, we focused on choosing the bacterial-encoded hyaluronidase Hy and flagellin FlaB as our key research molecules.

5515	McMasterU	ChloroNova: Proposing Algal Chloroplast as the New Status Quo for Biopharmaceutical Peptide Production	As the climate crisis intensifies and the cost of living rises, the demand for a circular economy has never been greater. Project Chloronova leverages microalgae as a scalable carbon-sequestering organism by partnering with major industrial polluters in our hometown of Hamilton, Ontario to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while producing high-value biomolecules. Unlike bacteria, microalgae offer the unique ability to perform post-translational modifications, make multiple heterologous proteins and withstand antimicrobial mechanisms. Inspired by our human practices research, Chloronova engineers microalgae to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), thus addressing the alarming rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the urgent need for sustainable bioproduction. Using PEG-mediated transformation in a cell-wall deficient strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (cw15+), we are able to introduce our plasmid into the chloroplast DNA of the microalgae. By optimizing AMP production within C. reinhardtii, we are creating a scalable, modular biofactory. It's a new day, and algae is here to stay.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounts for over 50% of SSTI cases. In the United States, SSTIs affect more than 14 million outpatients annually, with 900,000 requiring hospitalizations. The rise of antimicrobial resistance threatens the efficacy of antibiotics used to treat SSTIs, prompting the search for alternatives. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), especially those produced by thermophilic bacteria, have gained attention as potential solutions. In our project, we utilized bioinformatics tools to identify novel AMP genes in the genome of the thermophilic bacteria Brevibacillus borstelensis AK1, a thermophilic bacteria isolated from a hot spring in Saudi Arabia. We then designed a plasmid to contain these AMP genes and cloned them into Escherichia coli for heterologous expression, aiming to develop a novel AMP-based treatment for SSTIs in the face of rising antibiotic resistance.

Certain bacteria, like Salmonella and Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN), can selectively colonize tumors due to their ability to infiltrate the hypoxic cores of immune-deficient tumors. In this study, we utilized a lactic acid-responsive promoter to control the expression of anti-PD-L1 antibody or azurin killer protein. EcN was engineered as a tumor-specific drug delivery system to target tumors and locally release drugs, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and reducing both drug dosage and cost. This approach could provide new insights and strategies for cancer treatment.

It was previously shown that the outer capsid viral protein (VP4) is an essential target for developing a recombinant rotavirus vaccine as it mediates the attachment and penetration of rotavirus. However, the current live rotavirus vaccines show reduced effectiveness. Here, we focus on crafting a recombinant rotavirus vaccine with improved efficacy and safety. The coexpression of a human collagen type ? with VP4 in Escherichia coli was employed to generate oligomerization of recombinant rotavirus vaccines. Further, a stable hydroxyproline-free ABC heterotrimeric collagen mimetic system was used to produce a polyvalent rotavirus vaccine. Importantly, these newly designed vaccines utilize non-infectious virus-like particles with enhanced immunogenicity and protection, which could be considered viable candidates for further development to become a parenterally administered rotavirus vaccine.

5540	Stony-Brook	Targeted intracellular delivery of LshCas13a using bacterial DTA toxin-based platforms into targeted non-synthetic HIV-1 strains	Targeted delivery of therapeutic proteins toward latent HIV-infected cells remains a major challenge in eradicating HIV. Leading therapies block entry via envelope proteins or coreceptors, as well as reverse transcription. We developed a protein-based delivery system using a detoxified single-chain diphtheria toxin (DTA) as a translocation carrier across the cell membrane. This system delivers large protein cargoes, such as Cas13a, into cells in a receptor-dependent manner. A GP120 gene fragment was added to the fusion protein to act as the ligand for CD4+ T-helper cell receptors. These systems remain under development and low expression of Cas13a-DTA in E. coli (10-beta, Rosetta, and W3110 strains) poses challenges in extraction. Our research complements gene editing and external protein therapies to evaluate HIV cleavage in mimic CD4 receptor cells (HEK293). Quantifications of ssRNA cleavage via RT-qPCR will be presented, suggesting how effectively this treatment could extend to pharmaceutical applications.	Infectious Diseases	Gold Medal			2025	J.

5541	OUC-Haide	Yeast Medics?Hydrogel Wound Dressing Infused with Engineered Yeast's Healing Arsenal for Diabetic Wound Regeneration	"Globally, nearly 588 million people live with diabetes, and up to 25% of them suffer from chronic, non-healing wounds, facing risks of infection, gangrene, and even amputation. Current conventional therapies are ineffective and cumbersome, exacerbating patient suffering, while advanced treatments remain inaccessible due to high costs, limited functionality, or lack of dynamic regulation. To address this, we introduce ""Yeast Medics""--an innovative injectable dressing based on engineered Yarrowia lipolytica and L-DOPA-modified thermosensitive chitosan. This system dynamically senses wound status, displays antimicrobial peptides (Pexiganan) on the yeast surface, and programmatically releases both anti-inflammatory (IL-4) and pro-angiogenic (VEGF) factors. It synergistically addresses the three major challenges of infection, inflammation, and regeneration on a single platform, providing diabetic patients with an integrated, self-driven, low-burden healing solution."

5542	CJUH-JLU-China	Adipocyte for Breast Cancer Surveillance(ABCS)	Adipocytes can be transformed into cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) by cytokines from cancer cells. As CAAs demonstrate distinct gene expression pattern, we aimed to engineer adipocytes that could report such pattern. Systematic analysis revealed that the optimal combination to identify CAAs is PLOD2 and LIF, which could be induced by PAI-1 and CXCL8 respectively. We designed a RADAR sensor that targets the transcripts of PLOD2 and LIF simultaneously and delivered this sensor into differentiated adipocytes. These engineered adipocytes responded to the combined stimulation of PAI-1 and CXCL8 only. Most importantly, these engineered adipocytes responded to the treatment of the conditioned medium from breast cancer cells, revealing the potential of these adipocytes to respond to actual cancer microenvironment. We chose Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), an enzyme to generate luminescence, as output reporter. As Gluc could be secreted into urine, it offers a convenient way to report the results of in vivo cancer monitoring.

5544	Munich	InkSight	Tattoos have long served as markers of identity and belonging. InkSight repurposes this historical medium for modern medicine as a platform comprising engineered mammalian cells encapsulated in a hydrogel matrix for intradermal delivery as a tattoo. This system enables the real-time, equipment-free detection of circulating biomarkers through direct interrogation of the interstitial fluid. The engineered cells express a Modular Extracellular Sensor Architecture (MESA) for target recognition, which triggers one of three engineered contrast-change mechanisms: expression, assembly, or agglomeration. This response is driven by synthetic melanin-producing compartments, specifically encapsulin nanocages that house tyrosinase to enable localized and safe melanin production, resulting in a visible shift in tattoo contrast. InkSight constitutes, to our knowledge, the first paradigm for a continuous, cell-based tattoo biosensor with a visible output, establishing a foundational platform for decentralized diagnostics and personalized medicine.

5545	AFCM-Egypt	An Inhalable Probiotic Platform for RNA-Mediated Silencing for Asthma Management	Asthma is a very common respiratory disease, its severe form is often characterized by uncontrolled or corticosteroid-resistant inflammation. To overcome this, we developed PRESS, a modular therapeutic platform combining a probiotic delivery system (Lactobacillus plantarum) with an siRNA-based silencing tool (CO-BERA) targeting the inflammatory alarmin TSLP mRNA. Our engineered L. plantarum senses airway inflammation through dual inputs (Hydrogen peroxide and acidic pH) and, upon activation, synthesizes CO-BERA to silence TSLP and suppress downstream inflammatory pathways. For efficient administration, we designed a dry-powder inhalation system, optimized by computational fluid dynamics and validated for aerosol behavior and bacterial viability. PRESS adapted multi-layered biosafety measures, including a toxin-antitoxin kill switch to ensure containment. Reinforced by modeling-guided design and educational outreach with achieving eight UN SDGs. PRESS showcasing how engineered probiotics can function as living inhalable therapeutics, providing a safe, sustainable, and targeted solution for asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases.

5546	HKUST	Slupeer: Removal of Cadmium From Sludge	Cadmium is a severe heavy metal pollutant in several regions. Its effect as a pollutant threatens food safety, notably causing 14-17% of global cropland to be affected. Among sources of cadmium pollution, sludge is particularly detrimental with exacerbated consequences from downstream damage to human health and ecosystems. Within the sludge, there only exists trace yet still harmful concentrations of sludge, causing general heavy metal remediation methods to be ineffective against it. Simultaneously, it is the most significant ecological risk amongst heavy metals. Our team targets sludge and removes the pollutant cadmium by engineering Pseudomonas putida to express metallothioneins on its surface. Our team has introduced this metallothionein to the iGEM Registry and characterized it through Wet Lab Data and Dry Lab modeling. Supported by extensive Human Practices work, our team hopes to demonstrate the potential of our work and it as a promising and sustainable heavy metal bioremediation method.

5548	USP-Brazil	Glycosy-N-ation: Developement of microbial plataforms for the production of recombinant glycoproteins	N-glycosylation, the attachment of glycans to asparagine residues, is a critical post-translational modification that influences protein folding, stability, signaling, and activity. Over half of human proteins are glycosylated, yet current therapeutic glycoprotein production depends on eukaryotic hosts, as common models such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli are unsuitable. E. coli lacks an N-glycosylation pathway, leading to insoluble proteins, while S. cerevisiae produces hypermannose glycans that are immunogenic in humans. To overcome these limitations, we are engineering optimized microbial platforms for glycoprotein synthesis. In yeast, glycan chain extension is disrupted to generate simpler structures, and in E. coli, a de novo glycosylation system is reconstructed using modular Golden Gate-compatible parts. Both systems aim to produce the universal precursor Man?GlcNAc?. We developed 24 yeast mutants to evaluate growth, fitness, morphology, protein production, and glycan transfer, and incorporated archaeal oligosaccharyltransferases into E.coli to explore their ability to transfer glycans to human-like sequons.

However, factors such as climate change and human activities frequently lead to microbial outbreaks on mural surfaces, resulting in issues such as discoloration of mineral pigments, powdering and flaking of painted layers, and organic staining, which severely threaten their preservation. We have developed a microbial platform capable of producing antimicrobial peptides to inhibit the growth of fungi and bacteria, as well as generating enzymes to degrade organic pigments including melanin and carotenoids. This platform utilizes a pH-inducible switch to transcribe different products under varying pH conditions and incorporates a toggle-switch-based containment mechanism to ensure that our engineered bacteria survive only under specific conditions, thereby preventing environmental release.

5551	LYON	Engineered bacteria for PFAS degradation and dectection	Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are synthetic compounds composed of carbon-fluorine bonds that are nearly impossible to break down. First produced in the 1940s for their exceptional stability and resistance, they are now ubiquitous--in cookware, textiles, and firefighting foams--leading to their accumulation in the environment and human bodies. Long-term exposure has been linked to cancer, hormonal disruption, and immune dysfunction. Yet, no scalable, low-energy solutions currently exist for PFAS degradation. FluoroBreaker aims to address this challenge through two complementary strategies targeting PFOA and TFA. First, we used an AI-assisted bioinformatics docking approach to identify key mutations in a dehalogenase enzyme to enhance TFA degradation. Second, we engineered reporter bacteria carrying a promoter responsive to PFOA, enabling fast, user-friendly detection of PFAS in water. Together, these innovations pave the way for a sustainable, biotechnology-driven response to the PFAS pollution crisis.

5563	ULethbridge	Hyaluronext	Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a biomolecule widely utilized in healthcare and cosmetic applications. Traditionally, HA is extracted from animal or bacterial sources. Research has examined the potential of microbial production using non-pathogenic bacteria. These methods could be a promising ethical and scalable alternative. Given current demand, HA yields remain insufficient. We aim to maximize production efficiency through Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) and specialized E. coli. MAGE enables rapid, high-throughput modification of multiple genomic sites simultaneously, facilitating metabolic pathway optimization and synthetic biology applications. However, MAGE is hindered by high cost, complexity, and limited versatility of existing hardware. Our group is developing the Open-Source Automated Genome Engineering (O-SAGE) platform, leveraging affordable, commercially available components and open-source parts.

5564	JLU-NBBMS	BiOilRo: Sustainable Biosynthesis of Ginsenoside Ro for Valorization of Low-Value Carbon Sources in Waste Oil	Ginsenoside Ro is one of the rarest and most valuable bioactive compounds in ginseng, celebrated for its potent antioxidant properties and multi-target therapeutic potential. However, its natural abundance is extremely low, and traditional extraction methods are both costly and environmentally unsustainable. To address this challenge, we engineered a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae system capable of converting waste oil-derived carbon sources, such as glycerol and fatty acids, into Ro through an optimized three-step biosynthetic pathway. By integrating metabolic engineering, enzyme evolution, and modeling-guided optimization, we achieved a substantial enhancement in Ro yield while reducing resource consumption and environmental footprint. This platform exemplifies the principles of a circular bioeconomy, transforming industrial waste into high-value pharmaceuticals. Combining strong environmental benefits with significant economic potential, our work establishes a scalable, sustainable model for advancing green manufacturing and the future of synthetic biology-based healthcare.

5568	DTU-Denmark	NomNomNylon: towards a sustainable future for nylon waste	Fast fashion has accelerated the accumulation of synthetic textile waste, with nylon being among the least recycled fractions. Landfilling and incineration are the current disposal methods, producing microplastics and emitting greenhouse gases. NomNomNylon proposes a bio-upcycling strategy that couples enzymatic pretreatment with microbial valorisation. To enhance depolymerization, we developed a protein engineering pipeline to increase thermostability and activity while exploring nature's enzymatic diversity through sequence mining. These variants and homologues were tested in vitro using a cell-free assay on raw nylon. We employed a bioengineered Pseudomonas putida strain to metabolise nylon-derived oligomers and channel carbon flux toward indigoidine, a sustainable alternative to petrochemical indigo. Beyond lab work, we integrated feedback from experts, policymakers, and NGOs, and raised awareness among the public and youth through educational initiatives. We have shown that nylon waste can serve as a valuable feedstock for high-value products, contributing to a greener textile future.

Beyond direct CO2 fixation, the biological assimilation of the liquid one-carbon compounds, such as methanol, offers a promising alternative route for converting CO2 into value-added products. Aureobasidium melanogenum, a kind of poly-extremotolerant yeast-like fungus, exhibits remarkable potential for producing diverse bioproducts. Here, we established a CRISPR?Cas9 gene?editing system for A. melanogenum and elucidated the mechanisms underlying its methanol metabolism. By reprogramming key metabolic pathways, we constructed an engineered strain capable of synthesizing glucose from methanol. Furthermore, to optimize the cultivation of A. melanogenum, we developed a real-time methanol monitoring and automatic feeding device based on a gas-liquid exchange model, enabling convenient and accurate methanol concentration measurement. This study provides a foundational framework for leveraging A. melanogenumin the bioconversion of C1 compounds toward chemical production, highlighting its potential for sustainable carbon utilization.

Our team proposes PHAntom, a synthetic biology system using engineered E. coli to convert Martian CO? into bioplastics and metabolites. Our two-strain E. coli system converts CO? into PHBV via an acetate intermediate. Strain 1 autotrophically fixes CO? and secretes acetate using the pta-ackA pathway. Strain 2, aided by tdcB/tdcE for propionyl-CoA supply and tesB/yciA to balance 3HB/3HV monomers, converts acetate into PHBV. A bicarbonate-responsive cAMP-CRP mechanism enhances transcription under high HCO??, while CRISPRi knockdown of gltA diverts acetyl-CoA from the TCA cycle, optimizing acetate production and PHBV yield. Team PHAntom has built a clinostat to simulate non-Earth gravity conditions and an extrusion system to convert PHBV granules into printable filaments.

5572	Waterloo	HydroGuard	Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are the most common hospital infection, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as those in long-term care homes or the critically ill. While the standard treatments for these infections rely primarily on antibiotics, the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant infections demands for an alternative solution. To combat this issue, we have developed HydroGuard, a biocompatible, infection-responsive hydrogel with controlled phage release. Our hydrogel, made up of gelatin methacryloyl, degrades in the presence of gelatinase (gelE), a protein naturally produced by E.faecalis during infection. The degradation of gelatin in the hydrogel releases the embedded phage cocktail, which targets and eradicates the biofilm. Using a combined wet-lab and computational approach, our work demonstrates the viability of this solution by incorporating the gelE gene into E.coli for lab-safe proof of concept solution.

Current production relies on Streptomyces pilosus, which suffers from slow growth, low yields, and complex lifecycles that complicate industrial-scale fermentation, making it unsuitable as a production platform. Our team is transferring the desferrioxamine biosynthetic gene cluster to Rhodococcus, which doesn't naturally produce desferrioxamine but is well-established in industry for producing complex secondary metabolites. Rhodococcus offers fast growth, high scalability, and excellent fermentation characteristics. Both species belong to Actinobacteria, sharing similar genetic architecture, codon usage, and metabolic frameworks necessary for expressing the desferrioxamine pathway. To confirm successful pathway integration and transcriptional activity during transfer, we designed a split-GFP monitoring system.

Agriculture is one of the main drivers: synthetic fertilizers and animal manure release large amounts of ammonium, which soil microbes convert to nitrate. NCLOSE aims to counteract this by producing ?-polyglutamic acid (PGA), a natural polymer capable of reversibly binding ammonium, directly in manure. This reduces nitrate leaching while providing crops with a slow-release nutrient source. We introduced three genes encoding PGA synthetase into Clostridium cellulovorans, an anaerobic, cellulolytic bacterium, well-equipped for growth in manure. Additionally, we created resources to make this chassis more accessible for future teams, including adapted workflows, a genome-scale model and a taxonomic analysis. The development of a solid biosafety concept was also a central aspect. Through integrated human practices, we ensured NCLOSE remains safe, sustainable and socially responsible, turning manure from part of the problem into part of the solution.

Here, we identify conserved pausing sites across multiple human cell lines using EIF-based Ribo-seq and propose that such pauses facilitate proper protein folding. We developed PACD (Pause-Aware Codon Design), a computational framework that incorporates ribosome pausing information into mRNA optimization. A neural model trained on pausing sequences enables predictive integration with LinearDesign to preserve beneficial pauses during codon optimization. While pause-constrained designs slightly reduce mRNA stability and CAI, they are expected to enhance folding efficiency.

5591	Leiden	Splintein	The lack of precise control over post-translational modifications in synthetic protein production is a significant obstacle in research and biomanufacturing, especially in the development of biopharmaceuticals. To overcome this we developed Self Integrating Scaffolds (SIS), protein fragments flanked by split inteins. This project aims to insert a glycosylated SIS in Immunoglobuline G. To optimise our SIS, it's necessary to test how efficient two pairs of inteins can be used together. Because of that, we have designed a FRET assay, which enables us to test split intein pairs in high-throughput for their quantitative kinetic compatibility in real-time using only a plate reader. In addition, we applied dynamical modelling, docking simulations, structural comparisons, mathematical modelling and programming in R-studio to provide a more in-depth understanding of all these aspects regarding our SIS and FRET assay. Together, our results lay the foundation of using split inteins to change the world of protein engineering.

5593	SPC	Unravelling PET at the Seams	To alleviate the problem of plastic pollution and mitigate the serious impacts made by plastic on our environment, our team worked on multiple DNA combinations to break down PET. Our solution is HotPETase, an enzyme that can degrade PET plastics readily at high temperatures. We have paired it up with the genes BaCBM2 and CsgA respectively, then combined all three genes together to form our final gene combination. Out of all gene constructs, HotPETase-BaCBM2 showed the best performance, having the greatest increase in absorbance and the largest decrease in mass of the PET fragment at 70°C. Our main target gene combination, CsgA-HotPETase-BaCBM2 showed promising results during the absorbance test, having the second highest increase in absorbance at 60°C. SEM imaging was conducted on the PET samples, with irregular cracks being observed on the PET surface, in contrast to the smooth surface of the control.

5594	Concordia-Shanghai	PURPLE - Plastic Upcycling to Reduce Pollution and Loop the Economy	In response to the global challenge of plastic waste, our iGEM project aims to develop innovative biological pathways for the upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into high-value products, such as BHB (Beta Hydroxybutyrate). Our approach designs synthetic pathways in E. coli and P. putida, enabling them to convert PET waste into Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and later BHB. Utilizing computational tools and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we will optimize the engineered pathways to enhance the flux towards PHB production. This will include the use of kinetic models to predict and refine enzyme activity based on varying substrate concentrations. By designing and constructing novel biological parts, we aim to establish an innovative production pathway that aligns with circular economy principles. This will not only facilitate the conversion of PET plastic waste into valuable products but also provide a sustainable solution to a pressing environmental issue.

5598	Taipei-KCISLK-V3	DNA-Based Biosensors for Cardiovascular miRNA Detection with Machine Learning-Integrated Design Tool	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of global mortality, highlighting the need for rapid and sensitive diagnostic technologies. We developed an integrated nucleic acid-based biosensing platform that detects CVD-related microRNAs (miRNAs) with high specificity. The biosensor combines three-way junction (3WJ) probe recognition and a split G-quadruplex (G4) DNAzyme switch, where target-induced linker release reconstitutes the G4 structure. The G4/hemin complex catalyzes the oxidation of TMB, producing measurable electrochemical signals on a portable reader. The system achieved a limit of detection of 480 pM, demonstrating strong sensitivity and specificity. To accelerate probe optimization, machine learning (ML) models trained on experimental datasets (2500 miRNA-specific 3WJ probes and 728 split G4 probes) reached 83% accuracy for the 3WJ model and 80% for the split G4 model. This data-driven biosensor framework bridges biosensing probe design and ML prediction, enabling rapid, customizable, and cost-effective miRNA diagnostics for cardiovascular and other diseases.

It is caused by a parasite, and spreads through infected water samples globally. Current methods, such as qPCR, are expensive, unreliable and affected by inhibitors in faecal samples, with the most common methods having a sensitivity of around 40-60%. Using Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification, we designed a novel point of care diagnostic for the 18s rRNA of Cryptosporidium, designing an efficient primer set, and four new fusion Bst polymerases, with subdomains designed to increase reverse transcriptase activity, thermostability and inhibitor tolerance. Targeting 18s rRNA allows the test to detect 1 oocyst/gram of faecal sample (compared to qPCR's 300/gram). Results are shown colourimetrically for easy use. With our model and education work, we made the test even more accessible. It's time to shine a LAMP On Cryptosporidiosis!

5603	UNILausanne	REEvolutionaTe	Rare earth elements (REEs) and tellurium are essential for high-tech and renewable technologies, yet less than 1% are currently recycled. To address this, we developed a sustainable, bio-based strategy to recover these elements from e-waste streams. We engineered a modular system using amyloid protein fibers displaying REE-binding proteins, achieving high-affinity capture of REE ions and creating a powerful part collection. Mathematical modeling and molecular dynamics simulations guided design optimization, while a business plan and market analysis evaluated commercial viability. For tellurium recovery, we harnessed the Ter operon to efficiently reduce toxic tellurite into elemental tellurium. To promote our project and raise awareness of synthetic biology, we conducted extensive outreach through exhibitions, workshops, educational activities, blogs, podcasts, and interactive games across hospitals, museums, and schools. Thus, our project demonstrates an integrated synthetic biology platform for the biological recovery of REEs and tellurium from electronic waste.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), often aggravated by hairball accumulation, is a prevalent chronic condition that compromises digestive health. To address this, we developed MeowTrack, a programmable therapeutic probiotic platform that detects, treats, and records feline gut health. The system senses taurocholic acid (food intake) and calprotectin (IBD biomarker) and integrates these inputs through an AND logic gate, ensuring responses occur only under disease conditions with food available. Upon activation, MeowTrack expresses keratin-degrading enzymes to remove hairballs, butyrate-producing enzymes to restore gut balance, and chromoproteins or fluorescent proteins to visualize disease states in feces. Additionally, a Retro-Cascorder module records transcriptional events linked to inflammation, while a smart litter box equipped with fluorescence detection enables seamless, at-home monitoring of feline gut health.

5612	Lambert-GA	LANCET: A novel diagnostic and therapeutic combating Lyme Disease	89,000 cases of Lyme disease were reported to the CDC in 2023, yet experts estimate that nearly half-a-million Americans are infected with Borrelia burgdorferi annually. This significant underdiagnosis is due to the rapid dissemination of the bacteria into tissue, causing current tests to rely on antibodies produced weeks post-infection. However, the outer surface protein, CspZ, persists in the bloodstream, allowing for early detection through LANCET. Our diagnostic workflow begins with proximity-dependent ligation to detect CspZ and produce DNA, which is then amplified by recombinase polymerase amplification. Cas12a targets this DNA, providing a user-friendly output through a lateral flow assay. Even with improved diagnosis, treatment continues to rely on antibiotics, contributing to antimicrobial resistance and failing to address post-treatment Lyme disease.

Current treatments face a high recurrence rate. We stand to develop a more favorable treatment experience. Relevant studies have shown that the microbiome plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, particularly the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and its inflammatory effects. Based on this, we designed a therapeutic system using engineered Staphylococcus epidermidis. We genetically modified Staphylococcus epidermidis to sense the AIP-C secreted by S. aureus and activate two downstream therapeutic pathways. The first pathway produces an nanobody that targets and neutralizes the inflammatory cytokine, while the second secretes AIP-C to suppress the virulence of S. aureus. Together, our system offers a safe and long-lasting therapeutic strategy, representing a paradigm shift in atopic dermatitis management - moving from symptom suppression to microbiome-mediated disease prevention.

5617	Evry-Paris-Saclay	SOLARIS	Billions of years ago, cyanobacteria transformed Earth's atmosphere through carbon fixation, enabling the metabolic foundation of modern ecosystems. Yet, despite its central role, photosynthetic carbon fixation has not changed much since its origin. With SOLARIS, we reexamine this long-standing process from the perspective of synthetic biology, foundationally changing and advancing CO? fixation in cyanobacteria. Our solution lays the groundwork for photosynthesis 2.0 to overcome the kinetic and oxygen-sensitivity limitations of RuBisCO by introducing a distinct carbon fixation cycle supported by a carbonic anhydrase system we newly identified and confirmed for activity. This has the potential to make cyanobacteria far better at fixing CO? from the atmosphere and turning it into biomass.

5618	Thessaly	Clotho: Weaving a Cure for PDAC	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) causes nearly half a million deaths worldwide each year, with incidence and mortality rates almost identical, reflecting the lack of effective treatments. To address this, we developed Clotho, a modular gene therapy designed to cure PDAC. Using an adeno-associated virus, we deliver a therapeutic transgene that activates exclusively in cancer cells. Once inside, it produces circular RNAs and the enzyme Cytosine Deaminase. The circular RNAs act as sponges for tumor-promoting miRNAs, enhancing cancer cell sensitivity to treatment. Meanwhile, the enzyme converts the harmless prodrug 5-fluorocytosine into the toxic compound 5-fluorouracil, selectively killing malignant cells. Complementing this, our software platform Kathesis generates patient-specific circular RNA sequences based on individual genetic profiles. This dual approach enables precise, personalized, and targeted therapy, reducing off-target effects and introducing a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance in PDAC and potentially other diseases.

5619	Thailand-RIS	Plants vs. PET: Combatting Microplastic Pollution with Plant-Based PETase	Thailand ranked sixth in the world for mismanaged plastic waste, sending over a million tonnes into the oceans each year (Labcom et al., 2024). Microplastics are now found throughout the country's ecosystems--from marine animals to water, air, and farmland--threatening wildlife, food safety, and human health (Chanpiwat, 2021). The most common culprit is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), making up 37% of poorly managed waste. In 2016, scientists discovered PETase, an enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis that can break down PET. However, such microbial hosts are inefficient, unsafe, and unsustainable. Therefore, the Thailand?RIS iGEM 2025 team explored a different approach--producing PETase in plants--of which we present the first successful demonstration. Although stable transformation is still underway, we achieved transient expression of PETase fused with an alpha?amylase 3S signal peptide in Nicotiana benthamiana, resulting in extracellular secretion. This proof of concept lays the groundwork for scalable, sustainable plant-based strategies against forever-increasing plastic pollution.

As synthetic biology positions itself as a field of the future, the need for new tools that allow better control of protein expression and new options for genetic engineering is clear. SKIPPIT is a platform that harnesses the full power of STOP Codon Readthrough elements, from both characterising them to making them into a tool: a first-in-class readthrough riboswitch. STOP Codon Readthrough elements interact with the ribosome at the STOP codon site, leading to the STOP codon being decoded by a tRNA instead of the termination complex, allowing translation to continue beyond the STOP. Designing this switch has only been possible thanks to the development of a cutting edge Software: TADPOLE. This software uses computationally-predicted RNA structures to optimise the design of RNA switches from just two RNA sequences.

5624	KCIS-Xiugang-Taipei	CO2llectors--Overexpressing cmpABCD Fusion Bicarbonate Transporters Improves the Carbon Concentrating Mechanism in Cyanobacteria	Greenhouse gas emission is a major factor driving climate change. Considering the limitations of conventional mitigation approaches, our team proposed a synthetic biology approach by genetically modifying cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to enhance CO2 fixation efficiency. Our strategy involves overexpressing the cmpAB and CD fusion genes containing a light-sensitive promoter to increase the amount of bicarbonate transporter 1 (BCT1) within the cyanobacterial carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). Ultimately, we aim to increase inorganic carbon uptake and saturate RuBisCO's CO2 binding sites, facilitating photosynthetic CO2 sequestration. Coupling protein modeling and functional assays performed on wild-type cyanobacteria to obtain a dry lab model quantifying the cyanobacterial carbon intake, we envision integrating the engineered cyanobacteria into a carbon fixation photobioreactor. In addition, besides evaluating the scalability and sustainability of our hardware from a scientific and economic perspective, we also extended our outreach into the local and global community by educating about synthetic biology.

5626	KCISLK-Taiwan	LarVase: Bioengineering Cellulase with YebF-Mediated Secretion for Sustainable Manufacturing and Efficient Food Waste Degradation	Food waste has a huge impact on our planet. It destroys habitats, emits huge amounts of greenhouse gases, and threatens society deeply. Currently, one of the most sustainable methods is using black soldier fly larvae to degrade food waste. However, black soldier fly larvae are unable to efficiently digest cellulose, suggesting that improving the degradation process could enhance overall conversion efficiency and lower the costs associated with food waste treatment. LarVase aims to mass-produce endo-1,4-?-glucanase, a cellulase originating from Bacillus subtilis, through cloning into an E. coli BL21 expression vector. With our specially designed plasmids, we used YebF, a carrier protein having a similar function as a signal peptide, to be able to transport endo-1,4-?-glucanase outside the cell. This will lower the current costs of enzyme production while maintaining environmental sustainability.

To address the global health risks from pesticide residues, we have developed a simple, on-site detection system. At its heart are engineered bacteria containing a specialized RNA aptamer. When a specific pesticide is present, it binds to the aptamer, suppressing a fluorescent reporter gene and resulting in a dimmer glow. This provides an intuitive visual signal: brighter means safer, dimmer means contaminated. For precise results, we created companion software and hardware. A photo of the test sample is instantly analyzed, comparing the color intensity to a safety reference to display clear contamination levels. By integrating synthetic biology with smart technology, PestiGuard transforms complex lab testing into an accessible, user-friendly process, empowering everyone to make informed decisions about their food.

5628	GU-Frankfurt	SPROUT - Smart Peptide Release On Unique Triggers	Fungal pathogens pose a major threat to agriculture, causing significant economic losses and straining global food systems. Climate change worsens these challenges by creating warmer, more humid conditions that favor fungal infections. Conventional fungicides often harm beneficial organisms, disrupt ecosystems, and drive pathogen resistance, threatening long-term food security. We propose a more precise and sustainable alternative. Using a modular sensor system with a genetic AND-gate, our engineered bacteria detect pathogen-specific signals tied to physiology and secretome, releasing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) only when needed. This ensures targeted action while minimizing off-target effects. SPROUT is a scalable, precision-based platform for next-generation plant protection. Its modular design allows easy adaptation to diverse crops and pathogens, enabling efficient, on-demand AMP release. By combining specificity, adaptability, and sustainability, SPROUT offers a practical and innovative approach to strengthening agricultural resilience against fungal diseases.

5633	IIT-Bombay	AureoLyze	Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) forms biofilms that protect bacterial cells and confer strong resistance to antibiotics, making them a major cause of chronic and persistent infections. These infections are particularly harmful in immunocompromised patients, exacerbating conditions such as cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), a common skin commensal, secretes an extracellular serine protease (Esp) capable of cleaving autolysin, an essential factor in biofilm formation responsible for extracellular DNA (eDNA) release, which enhances biofilm stability. However, Esp also targets human biofilm components and other host proteins, limiting its therapeutic potential. To make Esp a viable therapeutic agent, it must selectively cleave bacterial biofilm proteins--specifically, autolysin--without degrading human substrates. To achieve this, we aim to engineer Esp through site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) to enhance its substrate specificity toward the autolysin. By introducing targeted mutations based on Esp-autolysin (Atl) interaction analyses, we seek to reduce its off-target activity against human proteins while maintaining its biofilm-degrading capability, enabling its safe use as an anti-biofilm therapeutic.

With the growing interest in its exploration, the use of local resources, especially water, is becoming increasingly important. However, its huge natural water resources are contaminated by toxic perchlorate salts and thus unusable. Therefore, we engineer Bacillus subtilis 168 to detoxify perchlorate fully and convert it into harmless chloride and oxygen. To measure perchlorate concentrations, we established an in vivo perchlorate quantification assay that functions via organic phase extraction. To understand the underlying biochemistry, we characterized perchlorate degradation enzymes in vitro and investigated the effect of rational mutations to improve their performance. To enable practical implementation of our project, we built and tested a low-cost DIY anaerobic bioreactor. In order to simulate Martian microgravity, we designed, built and verified a random positioning machine from scratch. This device enables biological studies in simulated microgravity environments.

5635	Sorbonne University	Nereis	Nereis' project focuses on conserving the marine environment by degrading the pollutant naphthalene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We identified salt-tolerant genes encoding proteins that help organisms survive in high sodium environments, as well as a catabolic pathway that uses naphthalene as a carbon source. Our goal is to genetically modify Pseudomonas putida, to be both salt-tolerant and capable of enhanced naphthalene degradation. These modification would allow the bacteria to function effectively in marine conditions. The naphthalene degradation pathway is found in P.putida G7, specifically in the NAH7 plasmid, which encodes the necessary degrading enzymes. Major challenges include adapting P. putida to high sodium concentration and introducing the large NAH7 plasmid. First, we will modified the bacteria with salt tolerant genes and test its tolerance to different sodium concentration. Second, we want to introduce the degrading enzymes in the salt-tolerant strain and assess the effectiveness of naphthalene degradation.

Building on Prof. Shang Cai's work on intracellular commensal bacteria--especially the tumor-targeting potential of Staphylococcus--we developed TroGen, an intracellular delivery platform using engineered commensals. To enhance invasion, we introduced the `fnbA` gene into non-pathogenic Staphylococcus to express S. aureus FnBPA, exploiting integrin-mediated endocytosis for efficient TNBC entry. Two biosafety modules confine bacterial survival and therapeutic payload expression to the tumor microenvironment. Using AlphaFold-Multimer, MD, MM/PBSA, and phylogenetic analysis, we selected the optimal FnBP from multiple candidates.

5644	NWU-CHINA-C	Targeting DDRs: Modular Biomanufacturing of Collagen	Type III collagen (COLIII) not only supports tissue elasticity but also regulates the tumor microenvironment by transmitting dormancy signals to cancer cells. To overcome the limitations of animal-derived collagen, we established a synthetic-biology-based microbial production system to produce humanized COLIII, achieving biosafety and functional customization. By introducing the GVMGFO motif, a specific binding site for Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1), we engineered COLIII to precisely target DDR1 on tumor cell surfaces. Using molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations, we selected the recombinant COLIII variant (rCOL III) with the most stable structure and highest binding affinity for DDR1.The selected rCOL III was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and showed preliminary intervention effects on breast cancer cells in vitro, demonstrating a potential inhibitory role. This project integrates synthetic biology, protein engineering, and computational design, providing a green and modular biomaterial strategy for breast cancer intervention and prevention.

5645	MIT-MAHE	PhytClub	Pepper foot rot is a devastating disease that affects black pepper (P. nigrum) vines. Caused by the oomycete Phytophthora capsici, the infection leads to extensive yield loss and mortality in Karnataka and Kerala. Globally, plantations in Vietnam and Indonesia also suffer a similar fate. Chemical fungicides and current biocontrol measures are ineffective and unsustainable, driving the need for an innovative solution. MIT-MAHE has developed a targeted, preventative solution that curbs foot rot. PhytClub implements small interfering RNA (siRNA) that are specifically designed to silence the bZIP transcription factor in P. capsici, through the RNA interference mechanism. Chitosan nanoparticles encapsulate the siRNA to confer stability and aid their uptake into the pathogen. Furthermore, the team has automated the siRNA design process and combined it with a model that predicts the stability of an siRNA-nanoparticle complex, providing a foundational software tool that helps future researchers seamlessly build gene silencing systems.

Our LOGIC project overcomes these problems by developing a novel approach to constructing a biocomputer--utilizing quorum sensing and spatial diffusion to form logic gates. For addition calculation, we construct high-pass and band-pass genetic circuits based on the quorum sensing (QS) system. Through the diffusion of QS molecules in solid media, we can build various logic gates and connect them to perform multi-bit binary calculations. For repetitive operation, we engineer a light-induced QS molecule degradation enzyme and a protein degradation tag to refresh the calculator. Building upon the calculator, we can also build accessories like result storage, decimal result display and latches, demonstrating its extensive prospects. Furthermore, we construct a LOGIC Toolkit with visualization software for future research.

5648	Alma	Com-bat-ing White-Nose Syndrome: Engineering E. coli to Secrete Protease Inhibitors Against Pseudogymnoascus destructans	Pseudogymnoascus destructans is a pathogenic fungus that causes White-nose syndrome (WNS), one of the most devastating wildlife diseases in modern history, responsible for mass bat mortality across North America. Locally in Michigan, 5 of our 9 bat species are affected--with repercussions for biodiversity, agriculture, public health, and environmental stability. WNS develops in bats during their hibernation period when proteolytic enzymes produced by the fungus degrade the collagen in their nose, ears, and wings, causing them to wake prematurely from wintertime hibernation, leading to energy depletion, lethargy, and death by starvation due to the lack of necessary resources in winter. There are no effective treatments currently. We propose engineering Escherichia coli to secrete serine protease inhibitor(s) targeting the virulence factor of the fungus. These inhibitors would block collagen degradation, allowing bats to maintain uninterrupted hibernation, thus improving survival outcomes for one of our most essential, if silent allies.

5649	TU-Delft	Snaccine	Snaccine is a novel type of vaccine, ideal for vaccinating chickens against avian influenza (bird flu). Genetically modified bacteriophages are taken orally, in a stomach acid-resistant pill. They reproduce inside gut bacteria, while also producing RNA packaged within armour (an MS2 virus-like particle coated with cell-penetrating peptides). This RNA enters (eukaryotic) host cells and works just like an mRNA vaccine, tricking the cell into producing an antigen. This antigen is detected by the immune system and teaches it to recognise and fight the original pathogen. Snaccines share many of the same advantages that mRNA technology has over traditional vaccines. But where typical mRNA vaccines have to be kept in freezers, Snaccines can be stored and transported at room temperature. Together with their cheaper production and oral administration route, Snaccine is an ideal technology for fighting bird flu.

5651	Lund	Trashformers - Enzymatic Glycolysis of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) textile fibres, and upcycling of terephthalic acid.	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the main component of polyester textiles, dominates global fiber production and generates millions of tons of waste annually. Current recycling methods rely on energy-intensive chemical processes. Our project, Trashformers, tackles this challenge by developing a synthetic biology system for PET textile recycling and upcycling, designed to provide all the reaction components needed for efficient depolymerization and upcycling. We focus on enzymatic glycolysis to depolymerize PET into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), a monomer suited for re-polymerization. To achieve this, we designed a system based on E. coli BL21(DE3) and devices utilizing PETase hydrolases. We design two complementary systems in parallel. The first employs enzymatic hydrolysis to degrade PET into terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol required for subsequent glycolysis. The second uses rational enzyme design to create a novel enzyme that activates TPA with coenzyme A Paving the way for PET upcycling through metabolic and chemical valorization.

5653	ULaval	Totally [Fe]rocious	Antimicrobial resistance is currently a major global health crisis. To counter this issue, alternatives to antibiotics must be developed. One promising strategy involves the use of siderophores, iron-chelating molecules naturally synthesized by bacteria. We aimed to hack this system by adding a gold nanoparticle to one of Klebsiella pneumoniae's siderophores, aerobactin. These nanoparticles can then be activated with NIR lasers to kill bacteria. Our team focused on cloning aerobactin in Escherichia coli. We also performed in silico analyses to optimize aerobactin biosynthesis and deepen our understanding of the siderophore's internalization by K. pneumoniae. A genome-scale metabolic analysis of aerobactin's citrate production, along with biomolecular modeling of the TonB-dependent transporter embedded in the gram-negative bacterial membrane, was conducted.

5654	ICJFLS	AromaWell: Customize Your Signature Aromatherapy Essential Oil	The core components of rose essential oil are geraniol and citronellol, while that of lavender is linalool. These three components share highly similar terpenoid biosynthetic pathways. This commonality provides us with an unprecedented technical opportunity: by modifying microbial cell factories, we enable yeast to produce geraniol (the common precursor substance) and Escherichia coli to synthesize citronellol and linalool. By enhancing the supply of precursor substances and introducing selective catalytic enzymes, we construct a metabolic network that can efficiently synthesize geraniol, citronellol, and linalool. The key lies in the introduction of regulatable promoter systems and artificial gene circuits, which allow for precise regulation of the metabolic flux of each synthetic branch through external induction and culture parameters. This enables end-users to dynamically adjust the synthesis rate of each component according to their personal preferences, and ultimately obtain personalized mixed essential oil components in a single fermentation system at one time.

5657	IIT-Madras	E.P.I.C : Epigenetic Programmable Intervention & Control	Targeted DNA methylation is a promising approach for programmable gene regulation. To explore this, we designed and expressed a novel fusion protein, dCas9-Dam (DNA adenine methyltransferase), in E. coli. dCas9 was directed to user-specified loci with the help of guide RNA, enabling targeted adenine methylation at GATC sites. We constructed a plasmid encoding dCas9-Dam with guide RNA and a reporter plasmid containing a GFP gene downstream of a methylation-sensitive promoter. Co-transfection into E. coli allowed us to assess whether dCas9-Dam could induce targeted methylation and regulate GFP expression. Our results will test the ability of dCas9-Dam to perform locus-specific DNA methylation and alter reporter gene expression.The system can be extended to other methyltransferases in bacteria, opening avenues for applications in biomanufacturing, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

However, current methods of heparosan production rely on inefficient microbial strains. Our project aims to design and optimize synthesis of heparosan in a more commonly used strain - BL21 (DE3). We are reconstructing the heparosan synthesis pathway found in E. coli K5 by expressing four essential genes--kfiA, kfiB, kfiC, and kfiD, and inserting them onto a single plasmid, incorporating a library of degenerate ribosome binding sites (RBS) on our primers. Using degenerate DNA sequences for our RBS allows us to synthesize a library of varying ribosomal binding affinity for each gene, which in turn, gives us a wide range of gene expression. This allows us to determine the optimal activity level for each gene to produce the most heparosan.

5659	DBHS-CA	ILXIR: IL-10 In Response	Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The cause of IBD is an overreactive immune response, leading to prolonged inflammation and tissue damage. A key regulator of such inflammation, Interleukin-10 (IL-10), plays a fundamental role in modulating inflammation and maintaining cell homeostasis by protecting the body from an uncontrolled immune response by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-? and IL-6. However, IL-10's therapeutic potential is severely limited by its structural instability due to its homodimer nature and easy degradation within the body. This instability reduces its effectiveness as a long-term treatment leaving patients with limited options for prolonged IBD treatments. To address this issue, we propose a probiotic-based approach, engineering a mutated more stable form of Il-10 (MIL-10). Delivered through dairy products like yogurt, this system would provide MIL-10 production in reaction to pro-inflammatory cytokines, ensuring sustained inflammation control for diseases like IBD.

5660	Washington	ExAway: A Protein Binding Inhibitor for Exotoxin A	Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a pathogenic bacterium that is responsible for an estimated 7% of all healthcare-associated infections. Exotoxin A (ETA) is one major virulence factor of PA. As a result, therapeutics targeting the inhibition of ETA activity are under development. ETA enters human cells through the CD91 receptor, activates via furin cleavage, and modifies eukaryotic elongation factor 2, inhibiting protein synthesis and inducing apoptosis. Although some inhibitors show signs of success, they consist of either small-molecule inhibitors, which have significant off-target effects, or antibodies, which cannot be produced efficiently due to size and folding properties. To address these limitations, we utilize RF diffusion, Protein MPNN, and AlphaFold to create a protein inhibitor that binds specifically to ETA's receptor binding domain. We tested these computationally designed inhibitors by expressing and purifying them, assessing their binding affinity to ETA and evaluating their ability to prevent ETA-mediated cell death using cell-based assays.

Currently, DF cannot produce H2 in commercially viable quantities. Our device, ""The Cysteinator"", solves this challenge by supplementing DF bioreactor feedstocks with precise concentrations of L-cysteine. L-cysteine lowers the oxidation-reduction potential in DF feedstocks, helping hydrogen-producing bacteria propagate and increasing hydrogenase function.

To address ?-lactamase-mediated resistance, PlasMission engineered a conjugative microbial system that transfers a plasmid encoding Beta-Lactamase Inhibitory Protein (BLIP) between bacteria. BLIP binds to ?-lactamase enzymes, restoring bacterial sensitivity to ?-lactam antibiotics. Using E. coli S17-1 as the donor, our system successfully delivered BLIP-I and BLIP-II plasmids into E. coli DH5?, causing ampicillin-resistant recipients to lose viability under antibiotic selection. We envision expanding this system into a conditional survival circuit with inducible BLIP expression, enhancing biosafety and enabling applications in biocontainment, therapeutic bacteria, and biosensing. Ultimately, our S17-1_BLIP system serves as a promising synthetic biology tool for re-sensitizing resistant bacteria, supporting rapid resistance detection, and contributing to safer, programmable antimicrobial interventions.

5670	Tsinghua	DuCon?A Dual-microbe system for vinasse recycling through Conversion to succinate	The treatment of Baijiu vinasse, which contains hard-to-degrade carbon sources, is a significant environmental challenge. For our iGEM project, we designed an innovative dual-microbe system to tackle this issue and produce high-value succinate. We genetically engineered Trichoderma reesei to secrete laccase (from white rot fungus) and its native cellulase. This enables the simultaneous breakdown of lignin into short arenes and cellulose within the vinasse. Subsequently, the engineered Pseudomonas putida is introduced to uptake these arenes and direct them into its modified TCA cycle. We specifically engineered this pathway to overproduce succinate and added an efflux channel for its secretion. This system promises efficient vinasse decomposition while generating a valuable chemical, balancing environmental sustainability with economic benefit.

5671	NYU-Abu-Dhabi	Revitalyze: Restoring Glycosylation, One Vesicle at a Time	"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of rare metabolic diseases caused by defects in various stages of the glycosylation pathway. Errors in glycosylation can confuse cellular interactions, causing serious malfunctions in multiple organs and organ systems. The most common type of CDG is PMM2-CDG (or CDG-Ia), where the mutation in the PMM2 enzyme, which converts mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, leads to decreased glycosylation rate. As a comprehensive solution to this problem, Revitalyze proposes engineering probiotics that deliver the functional PMM2 protein to the patient's body cells via bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs), thereby allowing an enzyme replacement therapy that minimizes disruption in the patients' daily lives. Starting with PMM2-CDG, our delivery system can be expanded to any other type of CDG caused by mutations in enzymes, and potentially other disorders as well. Revitalyze is more than a treatment; it's a step toward hope for all rare disorders."

5672	Freiburg	CONCAVE: Generating and Applying Antibody Alternatives	Antibodies play a crucial role in immunity by binding to specific antigens. Despite their widespread use, the production of antibodies remains costly and time-consuming, and dependent upon animal use. Our project, Concave, seeks to overcome these challenges by developing a modular synthetic biology platform to design customized binding proteins that mimic the versatility of antibodies and can be efficiently produced in E. coli. We are developing a scalable system for generating highly diverse leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins known as Repebodies, which are synthetic variants of lamprey VLRs that function similarly to antibodies. By combining this with retron-based mutagenesis, we enable continuous, in situ diversification of LRRs without manual intervention, allowing us to generate Repebodies that bind virtually any antigen. In order to use the Repebodies' target binding, we are designing Repebody-nanobody fusion proteins that interface with mammalian degradation machinery. This system is designed for degradation of membrane-bound or cytoplasmic proteins.

5673	JGU-Mainz	Pyricon - Spinning a Future with Spider Silk towards more sustainable construction materials	"Cement production accounts for about 8% of global CO? emissions (Kajaste & Hurme, 2016), and demand is expected to rise (Castro-Alonso et al., 2019; Lanjewar et al., 2025). At Pyricon, we address this challenge by creating a sustainable, bio-based alternative to cement bricks. We engineer Bacillus subtilis to produce spider silk proteins that enhance microbially induced calcite precipitation by another bacterium, forming a durable biocement. Using a novel PCR-free DNA assembly strategy and codon harmonisation, we aim to efficiently express highly repetitive silk genes. Our approach not only enables eco-friendly construction materials but also advances synthetic biology by providing a robust method for assembling reptitive DNA sequences. Scaled adoption of Pyricon's biocement could significantly cut embodied CO? in masonry and small-scale construction while extending material lifespan, offering a practical path toward a lower-carbon built environment."

5676	DUESSELDORF	STREAM	Bioproduction forms the basis of industries from food to textiles and pharmaceuticals, yet fluctuations in metabolite output and limited access to advanced equipment remain major challenges. STREAM addresses these by integrating proof-of-concept metabolic control with affordable, modular hardware, open-access software, and a predictive model. Our system enhances continuous metabolite production through a ratiometric biosensor that monitors concentrations in real time, enabling feedback-driven control. When product formation declines, inducers are added to overcome pathway bottlenecks and stabilize productivity. A mathematical model simulates inducer effects and metabolic dynamics, while an optimization algorithm balances inducer use and yield to minimize costs.An intuitive open-source software allows for easy hardware control. Together, these components demonstrate how low-cost, modular hardware combined with biosensor-guided feedback control can stabilize cultures, reduce metabolic stress, and enhance the reliability of bioproduction - making continuous bioprocessing more accessible, reproducible, and sustainable for teams and labs worldwide.

5677	LethbridgeHS	RhizoRetention: Creating drought-resistant Brassica napus through bacteria-mediated RNA interference	In Alberta, more than 14,000 farmers grow over 6.6 million acres of canola each year. As Canada's most valuable crop, canola contributes nearly $30 billion annually to the economy. However, climate change, particularly persistent drought, threatens productivity. Developing drought-resistant canola could help secure the sector's future. One promising strategy combines plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria with RNA interference (RNAi) to silence genes that reduce drought tolerance. A 2020 study in Arabidopsis thaliana found that overexpression of the transcription factor bHLH61 impaired drought tolerance, while loss of function improved it. Since a homologous gene exists in canola, targeting it may enhance drought resistance. Our approach engineers Arthrobacter globiformis to produce small-interfering RNA (siRNA) against bHLH61. Incorporated into seed coatings, the bacteria colonize canola roots and deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to silence the gene. This method could improve drought resilience in canola and help mitigate the impacts of climate change.

5678	CCA-San-Diego	ParkinSolve	Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and microglial-driven inflammation. Current treatments only alleviate symptoms without halting disease progression. To address this, we engineered CHO cells to secrete anti-inflammatory proteins (IL-1RA, IFN?R-Fc, and TLR4-Fc) that modulate microglial activation and protect neurons. Using a Tet-On 3G system, we achieved precise, doxycycline-inducible control of therapeutic protein expression. Conditioned media from transfected CHO cells improved BV2 microglial survival under rotenone-induced oxidative stress, with TLR4-Fc showing the strongest neuroprotective effect. This system demonstrates a controllable mammalian cell-based platform for adaptive, anti-inflammatory therapeutics in neurodegenerative disease.

Conventional protein engineering requires large-scale experimental data, extensive expertise, and prolonged trial-and-error processes, making research execution heavily dependent on institutional funding and human resources. Consequently, significant barriers remain for student teams and small-scale laboratories attempting to engage in protein engineering. LEAPS substantially reduces these constraints and provides an accessible environment for researchers to perform multi-objective optimization of proteins. This model enables student teams participating in iGEM and researchers with limited resources to undertake functional improvements such as enzymatic activity enhancement and antibody affinity optimization, dramatically expanding research possibilities. Furthermore, we have developed and publicly released LEAPS as a web application, establishing a platform accessible to the broader research community. This model has the potential to promote data-driven protein engineering and accelerate research and development across all fields of life sciences."

By mapping its genome and key metabolic pathways, we identify genes essential for building and maintaining its cell wall, which are targets that are unique to the pathogen and absent in healthy microbiota. With these insights, we aim to design next-generation antimicrobials that are precise, sustainable, and less likely to drive resistance.

Canker stain represents one of the most devastating threats to forest ecosystems worldwide, affecting all species of the genus Platanus, regardless of their size or age. It is a fungal disease caused by Ceratocystis platani. AMADRYADS is a chitosan-based nanocarrier system that encapsulates a plasmid. The plasmid cassette, delicately designed, contains a toehold-controlled Cas13d gene (a CRISPR/Cas ortholog that targets single-stranded RNA) and a gRNA array targeting two key fungal transcript, the products of the LysM and Res1 genes. With an emphasis on safety, we developed a non-GMO, biodegradable solution that operates on two specificity levels. First, it targets unique sequences found only in the fungus through gRNA modeling. Second, the toehold-controlled Cas13d gene is translated only in the presence of a species-specific toxin, ceratoplatanin (CP). Through these design features, combined with the high collateral activity characteristic of Cas13d, AMADRYADS aims to induce a total transcriptomic collapse of the pathogen.

Our project leverages synthetic biology to develop a sustainable solution to protect heritage sites from environmental deterioration. Our project comprises two parts. Firstly, we addressed acid erosion by engineering sulphur reduction pathways. We engineered E. coli to reduce sulfate and sulfite to cysteine. We utilised two genes, YdeD, which exports cysteine out of bacterial cells, and YhaM, which degrades cysteine, to drive the reduction pathway. Secondly, we employed silicatein-expressed E. coli to catalyse the formation of biosilica from tetraethyl orthosilicate. This biosilica could fill cracks in structures and improve structural integrity. We also adopted csgA adhesion domain, which ensures our engineered E. coli adheres to building surfaces under acidic conditions. Together with our hardware for crack-repairing and models to estimate corrosion, we believe our project can bring new insights for future heritage protection projects utilising synthetic biology.

5687	William-and-Mary	Aquarius: Channeling SynBio from the Lab to Aquatic Environments	The flow of water is essential to life on Earth, but can also carry negative consequences. Water movement transports pollutants to lakes, spreads harmful microbes through household plumbing, and corrodes infrastructure. Synthetic biology offers powerful solutions, yet few have been implemented in real-world aquatic environments. The lack of SynBio deployment in water environments stems from limited understanding of how engineered organisms function in dynamic environments, in which they must compete within native microbial communities, withstand shifting nutrient levels, and endure various physical stressors. Our project addresses this challenge through an integrated approach of chassis analysis software, predictive mathematical modeling, comprehensive RNA-seq meta-analysis and experimentation with engineered constructs in laboratory and aquatic settings. By analyzing how synthetic circuits behave in flowing water compared to laboratory settings, we uncover foundational design principles that will enable the development of safe, effective synthetic biology applications to tackle pressing global challenges linked to aquatic environments.

5689	Groningen	CRIKIT: Developing a rapid CRISPR-based diagnostic kit for detecting antibiotic resistance	Antibiotic resistance is one of the most critical emerging threats to global healthcare, with current projections indicating it will surpass cancer as a leading cause of mortality in the coming decades. Conventional methods for identifying antibiotic resistant infections are time-consuming, as they depend on culturing bacteria in the presence of antibiotics. This diagnosis delay often leads to trial-and-error treatment strategies, which not only compromise patient outcomes but also promote the spread of resistance. To address this challenge, we are developing CRIKIT, a rapid and versatile diagnostic tool based on using Cas13 and programmable guide RNAs (gRNAs) directly from cell lysate to target bacterial transcripts of specific antibiotic resistance genes. By adding a fluorescent reporter we use Cas13's collateral cleavage activity to generate a measurable fluorescent signal. This approach will enable clinicians to make rapid, targeted decisions about antibiotic therapies, reducing the reliance on empirical treatments and improving clinical outcomes.

Available oral vaccines depend on a strict cold chain (2-8°C), a fragile system that collapses in areas exposed to extreme temperatures and power outages. Climate crisis worsens this situation: flooding and droughts promote Vibrio cholerae proliferation. Spiky'Mune provides an innovative alternative: transforming Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear cactus) into an edible vaccine producing CTxB protein, a non-toxic immunogenic fragment of cholera toxin. This approach relies on the cactus's exceptional properties: tolerance to arid climates, rapid growth, and massive biomass production (200 tons/ha/year). Its cells naturally protect proteins against gastric degradation. Our strategy includes CTxB expression validation in E. coli, transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana, then stable cactus callus transformation. By eliminating refrigeration requirements and promoting local production, Spiky'Mune addresses logistical, economic, and climate challenges while pioneering edible vaccines against enteric pathogens.

5693	ETSU	Unlocking Hidden Nutrition in Seeds with AI and Promoter Engineering	Micronutrient deficiencies (hidden hunger) affects over two billion people globally. This happens from a lack of vitamins and micronutrients, even in diets sufficient in calories. Seeds provide energy, but are often poor in essential vitamins. Plants can synthesize certain vitamins, but some of the key genes for the biosynthesis are not active in seeds. We aim to unlock the natural potential of seeds by engineering the promoters of key genes for vitamin biosynthesis in soybeans. To predict the gene expression patterns in seeds, we trained a machine learning model using seed and non-seed specific gene promoters. This simulates mutations in native gene promoters and predicts whether a mutation can increase the gene expression in seeds. To test this, we introduced a RUBY reporter system.

5694	HAOLVE-Nanjing	REEnaisance: Reimagining Rare Earth Element Extraction Through Bioabsorption	"Rare earth elements (REEs), often referred to as ""industrial vitamins"", possess unique physicochemical properties that make them vital components in high-tech industries including optics, electronics, and magnetism. However, conventional extraction and separation techniques--such as sulfate roasting, alkali leaching, and ammonium salt leaching--are associated with severe environmental pollution and ecological damage. In response, microbial bioleaching and biosorption using bacteria represent a promising green alternative, offering an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable strategy for REE recovery. In this project, we first validated the REEs adsorption capacity of Pseudomonas kunmingensis (P. kunmingensis) HL22-2T, and subsequently engineered the strain with key genes involved in polyphosphate metabolism. By reprogramming its phosphate regulatory network, we aim to enhance the strain's ability to adsorb REEs, aligning with the principles of sustainable biotechnology."

5695	UChicago	Phospho-NO: Preferential Binding of Phosphorylated Proteoforms In Vivo	Phosphorylation is a critical post-translational modification that modulates key cellular processes, yet selectively isolating and studying specific phosphorylated proteins remains a major challenge. Existing tools like phosphorylation state-specific antibodies often lack absolute specificity and require extensive validation. To address these challenges, our project introduces a novel approach that integrates the phosphorylation-specific binding capacity of 14-3-3 proteins with a synthetic binder engineered for high affinity and target specificity. This combination enables precise recognition of a single phosphorylated protein isoform. Coupled to an E3 ligase recruitment system, this 14-3-3-Degradation Complex could facilitate selective ubiquitination and degradation of the phosphorylated target, offering a versatile platform for both phosphoprotein characterization and therapeutic targeting. Using C-Raf as a model substrate, we demonstrate enhanced site-specificity, highlighting the potential of this system to advance phospho-proteomic research and targeted cancer therapies after further research is performed.

5696	Boston-BOSLab	BloomBusters	Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms that can form harmful algal blooms. These blooms can lower oxygen levels, resulting in mass wildlife mortality. Microcystis aeruginosa, a common bloom-forming species, also produces the hepatotoxin microcystin, which accumulates in the food chain and induces severe physiological effects. Through rounds of discussion with experts, we found that early detection of microcystin is critical for effective management but remains limited. Current methods are slow, inconsistent, expensive, and unable to distinguish toxic from other strains. BloomBusters introduces a novel detection method based on CRISPR-SHERLOCK: an RNA-based fluorescent biosensor targeting toxin biosynthesis genes in Microcystis. This system enables rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of toxin-producing cyanobacteria within hours, allowing timely interventions and improved water safety. We demonstrated detection in mcyE/B RNA targets from Microcystis, allowing detection and management of toxic blooms using synthetic biology approaches, protecting ecosystems and public health before it's too late.

Our work addresses this through two complementary strategies: antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for knocking down proteins implicated in the formation of stress granules and RNA aptamers for limiting TDP-43 aggregation. We identified three proteins whose knockdown reduces SG assembly. For each, we developed, generated, and validated a panel of ASOs through computational modeling and in vitro testing. ASOs targeting DAZAP1 and FAM98A, two critical stress-granule-associated proteins, demonstrated significant protein knockdown and SG suppression. We also developed a machine learning model to predict ASO efficacy for increased wet-lab efficiency. In parallel, we generated RNA aptamers targeting TDP-43's C-terminal domain through a computational pipeline; top candidates bound to TDP-43 with high specificity in vitro. Our dual-strategy approach offers a layered therapeutic strategy for ALS and establishes a novel framework for future disease research."

Unlike conventional chemical pesticides, which pose significant hazards to ecosystems, humans, and animals, our approach uses biodegradable polypeptides, ensuring both high efficacy and ecological safety. The project is structured into two components: attraction of termites and their targeted elimination. The attraction mechanism uses the Cytochrome P450 enzyme from Bacillus megaterium to catalyze the conversion of phenol into hydroquinone, a phagostimulant to enhance termite feeding behavior. For the control strategy, two approaches have been devised: (1) disruption of the termite's symbiotic protozoa within the gut via antimicrobial lytic peptides Hecate and Melittin; and (2) inhibition of digestive processes via an Enterolobium contortisiliquum trypsin inhibitor, which blocks key digestive enzymes. By utilizing biologically-based alternative toxins, our team aims to target and suppress termite infestations while achieving sustainability and environmental protection."

The assay is combined with DNA-gold nanoparticle (GNP) technology, providing a simple and rapid visual readout. Initial development and validation with laboratory strains (e.g., Pseudomonas putida) demonstrated sensitivity down to sub-nanomolar genome DNA concentrations, with distinct fluorescence and later with GNP-based signals. The system was then adapted for Arsenophonus sp., a pathogen affecting potatoes and other root vegetables. Tests under realistic conditions indicated the tool's potential for in-field diagnostics, supporting faster decision-making and more timely interventions. Challenges remain, particularly in improving sensitivity and ensuring robust readouts in complex biological samples. Nonetheless, this proof of concept highlights a promising direction for accessible and field-deployable pathogen detection.

5702	Japan scinet	PreserVEG	"Every year, 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted globally, with fruits and vegetables making up 45% of this loss. Fresh produce keeps respiring after harvest and is very sensitive to gases like ethylene. Climacteric fruits release ethylene, which accelerates their ripening and deterioration nearby produce. Since we often judge freshness only by appearance, edible food is sometimes thrown away. And if deteriorated food is left alone, safety risks like foodborne illness increase. To solve this problem, we developed PreserVEG, a Cre/loxP-based three-in-one system for climacteric fruits and vegetables. It has three key functions: Protection -- nisin stops harmful bacteria; Sense -- detection of ethylene gas; Visualization -- GFP is expressed when deterioration begins. Using the Cre/loxP system, nisin protects produce while fresh, then ethylene triggers GFP to show spoilage. PreserVEG helps keep fruits and vegetables fresh and reduces global food waste."

5705	BYU-Provo	Inara - Illuminating Early Pregnancy and Miscarriage	The majority of miscarriages, such as those resulting from genetic abnormalities in the miscarried fetus, are explainable. But in a significant number of cases, even scientists don't have all the answers to why miscarriage happens - partially due to stigma that drives women into silence and inhibits research. Progesterone, a female sex hormone whose levels exhibit within-day variability, is correlated with miscarriages, but no technical platform exists to monitor these levels in real time. We aspire to illuminate early pregnancy and miscarriage by developing such a platform using synthetic biology - specifically, impedimetric aptamers. We anticipate that this platform will expand women's health research, empowering women with better health tools and more opportunities for self-advocacy in early pregnancy. We validated our chosen bio-impedimetric aptamer system beyond the extent of existing literature. We developed hardware, human practices, and a business plan to minimize technical and market risk and maximize ethical impact.

Arthropod-borne diseases (ABDs) such as malaria, dengue, and Zika cause over 1 billion infections and 700,000 deaths annually, with rising incidence due to urbanization and climate change. To address the limitations of existing repellents, we developed ARBOGuard: a synthetic biology platform that reprograms the skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis to reduce mosquito attraction. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we disrupted ldh to lower L-lactic acid production (a mosquito attractant) and introduced genes for geraniol biosynthesis (a natural repellent). To enable in-situ modification of S. epidermidis, we engineered Khosrow, a recently discovered lysogenic bacteriophage specific to S. epidermidis, to deliver both constructs. Multiple topical delivery formats incorporating phages into sprays, aerosols and creams were tested, demonstrating effective application across multiple user-friendly products. Ultimately, ARBOGuard demonstrates the feasibility of engineering the skin microbiome into a durable barrier that protects against ABDs, establishing a framework for longer-lasting, innovative topical repellents.

To support its practical application, we created two complementary platforms: a rapid colorimetric biosensor for quantifying triacylglycerol accumulation, which is a key indicator of R. opacus growth and metabolic activity, and a computational tool for predicting optimal metabolic pathways and identifying candidate genes for pollutant degradation. Our project aims to enable HERO to be customized and easy-to-used for diverse environmental pollutants, bridging the gap between fundamental research and real-world bioremediation solutions.

5717	Cornell	Developing Scalable Perchlorate Removal in Martian Regolith via a Novel Microbial Coculture and ARC Bioreactor	Martian soil is rich in perchlorates, a molecule found to be toxic to both plant growth and human homeostasis. This compound serves as a significant barrier to Mars exploration and long-term colonization. Team Cornell proposes PRoSPER, Planetary Removal of Soil Perchlorates and Enrichment Remediation, as a means of establishing future Martian settlements through bioremediation and traditional agricultural development. PRoSPER utilizes a microbial coculture of E. coli with a genetically engineered perchlorate reductase pathway, and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to uptake the resulting chloride byproducts. This coculture will be housed in a novel Adaptive Reaction Chamber bioreactor family that is easily adjusted to optimal growing conditions. PRoSPER improves the viability of Martian settlement by not only removing a key obstacle to plant growth but also encouraging a dual-market strategy approach that can be used to advance the future of space exploration.

5718	Tec-Chihuahua	Phasea: recombinant antifungal peptides encapsulated in chitosan microparticles for next-generation biofungicides	Plant diseases caused by fungi threaten global food security, causing severe yield losses and dependence on chemical fungicides that harm the environment and human health. Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum genus, exemplifies this problem. Despite advances, sustainable and precise disease management tools remain limited. Phasea addresses this challenge through a next-generation biofungicide that combines recombinant antifungal peptides with chitosan-based microparticles for controlled, prolonged release. Its formulation integrates the synergistic action of CaLTP1 + PDF1.2 and PvPGIP2, engineered for broad antifungal activity, while biodegradable chitosan ensures protection, stability, and gradual delivery in crops. To optimize formulation, we developed a mathematical model coupling peptide release kinetics with fungal inhibition dynamics, enabling data-driven design and predictive testing. Beyond the lab, Phasea integrates a sustainability-oriented business model targeting distributors and farmers. Together, Phasea unites synthetic biology, human practices, and entrepreneurship to foster safer and more resilient crop protection.

5719	Duke	RESPIRA: Responsive Engineered Strain for Polymicrobial Infection Recovery in Airways	Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) arises when antibiotic-resistant bacteria form biofilms on endotracheal tubes, shielding pathogens from treatment. RESPIRA is a Bacillus subtilis-based living therapeutic engineered to detect and dismantle these biofilms at their source. Triggered by pathogen quorum-sensing signals, RESPIRA activates a synthetic gene circuit that drives secretion of enzymes to degrade the biofilm matrix, restoring bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and immune attack. Our team integrated wet lab, modeling, and ethical design. We assembled quorum-sensing circuits, optimized B. subtilis transformation, and built clearFoam, an open-source reaction-diffusion simulator linking gene-circuit activation to biofilm degradation and BioBrick parameters. Sensitivity analysis and experimental diffusion data validated this framework. Guided by clinicians and ethicists through a responsible research framework, we prioritized receptor-based circuit feedback, gel delivery, and biocontainment. Together, these innovations make RESPIRA a programmable, safe, and clinically informed therapy that converts biofilm infections from persistent to treatable.

5720	UManitoba	LacThera - Lactobacillus therapy.	The vaginal microbiome is crucial for reproductive health, mainly dominated by Lactobacillus spp., which protects against pathogens by producing antimicrobial compounds. Disruption of this balance can lead to infections like UTIs. And 30% of women with UTIs experience recurrent infections. While antibiotics are the main treatment, resistance and microbiome disruption limit their effectiveness and don't address the problem of recurrent UTIs. Probiotics using Lactobacillus strains can help restore balance, but often struggle against pathogens. We chose to augment Lactobacillus crispatus with peptide inhibitors that target pathogen adhesion mechanisms, helping prevent colonization.	Therapeutics	Silver Medal			2025	David B.

5721	SubCat-China	Construction of a chitinase expression genetic system and its application in biomass resource degradation	Chitinases, which catalyze the degradation of chitin, have the ability to degrade fungal cell walls and insect exoskeletons and produce N-acetylglucosamine oligomers or monomers. Therefore, they play an important role. In this project, we screened three chitinases and chitin deacetylases from microbial sources. We then constructed a genetic system expressing chitinases by recombining the in vitro synthesized genes into plasmids and expressing them in Escherichia coli. By testing chitin expression and enzyme activity, as well as the optimal reaction conditions for enzyme activity, we optimized the constructed E. coli genetic system and adjusted the expression conditions to increase chitinase production and activity. By degrading these chitin wastes, chitin can be recovered into valuable products such as amino acids, calcium lactate, and high-purity chitin, thereby improving the utilization of biomass energy. Furthermore, we combined chitin exonucleases or endonucleases with chitin deacetylases to explore the synergistic effect of enzymes on chitin degradation.

The Hippo signaling pathway, which includes key components such as large tumor-associated kinases, and the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TEAD4, plays a critical role in regulating cell growth. Recent studies have identified TEAD4 as a crucial player in breast cancer development. In our research, we utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 system to design specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that target and knock out TEAD4 in breast cancer cells. This genetic manipulation showed promising results in inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis reinforced the critical role of TEAD4 in tumorigenesis.

However, the extreme dryness and temperature conditions on the Martian surface make it impossible for Earth's crops to grow normally, jeopardizing human survival. To address this challenge, the WUXI-DSAS team has proposed a solution: endowing plants with tolerance to the Martian environment. By integrating genes with various stress-resistant functions into plants, their ability to withstand extreme conditions is enhanced, thereby reducing the energy and water consumption of plant greenhouses. Ultimately, this could enable plants to be directly cultivated on the Martian surface. Additionally, this technology can be applied to crop cultivation under extreme conditions on Earth. We firmly believe that one day, we will sow seeds of hope on the surface of Mars.

To enable data-driven decisions, we curated literature and clinical data and built ProbiEase, a platform that integrates a knowledge graph, strain search, and an AI chat interface to generate traceable, citable candidates. We then conduct a second-stage triage via metabolic modeling, evaluating coexistence and cross-interaction potential to derive synergistic strain sets. Using Parkinson's disease as a case study, we showcase an end-to-end workflow--evidence aggregation ? platform prioritization ? modeling-based vetting--and, targeting PD-specific needs, propose intranasal nose-to-brain delivery of an engineered probiotic consortium with a modular design spanning adhesion, therapy, control, and safety."

By optimizing expression conditions and fermentation processes, the soluble expression of these two enzymes will be achieved efficiently. Subsequently, a green biomanufacturing process will be established for the large-scale production of novel functional sweeteners--agaro-oligosaccharides (AOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)--which exhibit both a low glycemic index (GI) and significant prebiotic properties. This technological approach is designed to fundamentally address the health controversies and application challenges associated with existing sweetener products, offering the food industry a safer, more efficient, and cost-effective healthy sweetening solution.

5726	HBUT-China	Improve Cyclic Lipopeptide Production through Random and Rational Mutagenesis	Plant diseases pose a major threat to global food security and economy. Chemical pesticides cause escalating pathogen resistance and environmental contamination. Cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) produced by Bacillus species offer a promising and sustainable alternative. However, their large-scale application remains limited due to the low production titers of native strains. In this project, we engineered Bacillus velezensis through an integrated synthetic biology pipeline. ARTP mutagenesis and high-throughput screening were used to isolate high-yield mutants. Key gene mutations were identified and reconstructed in the wild-type strain. A dual-gRNA system was designed to efficiently delete long gene fragments. Furthermore, a computational protocol was designed for NRPS communication (COM) domains prediction and used to direct gene cluster mutagenesis. Overall, our work establishes a modular engineering framework for optimizing and innovating CLP-based biopesticides, offering effective and sustainable solutions for crop protection and contributing a versatile genetic toolkit to the synthetic biology community.

Guided by rational mutagenesis and machine learning approaches, we engineered and evaluated six TfCut2 variants with the potential for enhanced degradation performance compared to the wildtype. To improve accessibility of the textile substrate, we apply mechanical disintegration and chemical pre-treatment, followed by enzymatic treatment using cellulases for the cotton fraction and TfCut2 variants for PET. Ultimately, the process seeks to degrade blended textiles into the monomer terephthalic acid (TPA), which can then be repolymerized into PET textiles, enabling closed-loop recycling for sustainable management.

5732	SHSD	Engineering Heat-Tolerant Algae to Address Global Warming	Global warming is becoming an increasingly serious problem, primarily due to the massive emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, resulting from human activities. Microalgae, as photosynthetic aquatic organisms, hold significant potential for carbon dioxide fixation. However, the rising prevalence of high temperatures associated with global warming poses a serious threat to the survival of many plants and crops, including microalgae. To address this challenge, we are overexpressing the endogenous gene CPN60C in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. CPN60C is a mitochondrial galactose-binding protein that enables Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to survive and maintain photosynthesis under heat stress. In this project, we transformed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the plasmids containing CPN60C, generating transgenic strains that overexpress the gene. This enhanced their ability to withstand high temperatures and photosynthesize efficiently. Our long-term goal is to develop heat-tolerant algae capable of surviving elevated temperatures and fixing carbon dioxide efficiently, thereby providing a practical approach to mitigating global warming.

5738	SUIS-PINGHE	Research on the Application of Mussel Adhesive Proteins in Antibacterial Coatings for Medical Devices	Mussel foot proteins (Mfps) are a class of proteins secreted by mussel byssus, featuring exceptional underwater adhesion, waterproofness, toughness, and durability. They exhibit great application potential in fields such as biomedicine, cosmetics, and medical coatings. However, the current production of Mfps mainly relies on direct extraction from mussels, a process that is costly, inefficient, and unable to meet the demand for high yield and consistent quality. To overcome this bottleneck, the present study aims to explore the use of Escherichia coli as a biosynthetic platform for the efficient production of Mfps through a heterologous expression strategy. Furthermore, by applying sequence-based molecular design, we seek to construct functional fusion proteins with strong adhesiveness, enhanced antibacterial activity, and good biocompatibility for the preparation of antimicrobial coatings for medical devices.

5740	SubCat-Shanghai	Parkinson's disease treatment - new probiotic therapy	Current treatments for Parkinson's Disease primarily rely on levodopa (L-DOPA), a dopamine precursor, to alleviate symptoms. However, traditional L-DOPA synthesis methods, including chemical methods and plant extraction, are inefficient and environmentally unsustainable. Microbial biosynthesis has emerged as a promising alternative, although its efficiency is limited by the conversion of chorismate to L-tyrosine. This study aimed to enhance L-DOPA production by optimizing the expression of the tyrA gene in Escherichia coli and screening different RBS. Furthermore, given that gastrointestinal symptoms are a common side effect of L-DOPA, constructing a probiotic strain capable of efficiently expressing L-DOPA could not only mitigate side effects by modulating the gut microbiome, but also achieve the goal of treating and alleviating Parkinson's symptoms through continuous drug release.

5741	SubCat-Union	Production of 3'-Sialyllactose (3'-SL) Using Soy Whey	Based on synthetic biology principles, this project aims to construct an E. coli that uses low-cost soy whey as a fermentation medium and leverages the natural galactose in soy whey to achieve an auto-induction expression system. The experiment is mainly divided into the following three parts. First of all, at present, E.coli can't use carbohydrates (such as sucrose and stachyose) in soy whey as carbon sources, which makes it difficult to use this rich food industry by-product as fermentation medium. Secondly, we want to construct a self-induced protein expression system. Based on this system, bacteria can directly use galactose in the culture medium as an inducer, thus spontaneously inducing the expression of downstream proteins. Finally, we need to transfer the synthesis module of 3'-SL into plasmid, so that bacteria can synthesize 3'-SL protein in soy whey.

Throughout the project, E. coli and C. reinhardtii were used as model organisms to evaluate different flocculation systems, including FLO1, Z17/Z18, and the endogenous adhesion pair FUS1/MAR1. Although the FLO1 construct assembly was hindered by repetitive sequence regions, the Z17 protein was successfully expressed and purified in E. coli. Expression of Z18 and cloning of the GP1 anchoring protein were not achieved due to sequence complexity. In parallel, electroporation parameters for C. reinhardtii transformation were optimized, and a flocculation assay was established to assess aggregation efficiency, providing a foundation for future development of auto-flocculating microalgae strains for sustainable biotechnology.

Without real-time feedback, many unknowingly overtrain, increasing the risk of injury. Lactate--a key marker of fatigue, training intensity, and anaerobic metabolism--is still mainly detected through costly instruments and invasive blood sampling, limiting its everyday use. To solve this, we developed a synthetic biology-based biosensor using engineered E. coli to express lactate oxidase, enabling detection of lactate in sweat through either a visible color change or an electrochemical signal. Our goal is to make scientific, precise training accessible to everyone. Whether for beginners or professional athletes, our sensor provides real-time insights into physical status, supporting smarter workouts and healthier progress.

5755	Toulouse-INSA-UT	PFAway: the end of forever pollutants	"PFAS, also known as ""forever chemicals,"" are man-made compounds found in countless everyday products. Their remarkable resistance to heat, grease, and water comes from exceptionally strong carbon-fluorine bonds. But this stability comes at a cost: PFAS do not break down. Contamination is now global, and calls for a solution. We introduce PFAway, a real-world PFAS degradation process relying on two bacterial strains immobilized in carbon-activated beads. A newly identified strain, Labrys portucalensis F11, is first used to degrade long-chain PFAS into short-chain PFAS. Pseudomonas putida KT2240 then defluorinates short-chain PFAS through an engineered dehalogenase obtained by hypermutagenesis in E. coli. Dehalogenase variants are screened based on a fluoride biosensing aptamer implemented in droplet microfluidics. Improved dehalogenases are finally expressed in a modified P. putida that is made resistant to fluoride ions through the overexpression of the fluoride transporter FluC. This end-to-end process paves the way towards industrial-scale PFAS decontamination."

First-principles models that span promoter dynamics, translation initiation, ribosome traffic, decay, and dilution predict absolute mRNA/protein levels and map inducer-to-transporter dose responses under burden constraints. Performance is quantified with a dual-plasmid, dual-reporter scheme: one tracks pLuxR activity (GFP), while a second constitutively expresses LuxR; both are tunable via promoter, RBS, and terminator strength. Standardized parts, low-copy backbones, and optional split-plasmid configurations yield predictable, tightly gated zinc uptake for biomining, biosensing, and materials recovery.

5761	KhanLab-BayArea	Rock The Plastics	Microplastics are increasingly widespread. Jambeck et al. find that 5 to 12 million tons of plastic pollute the ocean annually. Plastics put into landfills degrade into microplastics that leach into the environment. These microplastics travel up the food chain, with the average person eating, drinking, or breathing between 78,000 and 211,000 microplastic particles every year. At the same time, the U.S. Geological Survey reports that 1 billion tons of limestone are quarried yearly in the United States alone. Our team addresses both of these issues by engineering E. coli to co-express plastic-binding curli fibers and a biomineralization pathway, effectively capturing microplastics in in situ limestone formations. We are using microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) for biomineralization, investigating a carbonic anhydrase pathway and a urease pathway.

Addressing this challenge, our work first enhances and integrates the erythritol biosynthesis pathway in bacteria through molecular biology techniques. Additionally, we introduce a glycerol metabolic pathway, which serves dual purposes: reducing byproduct formation and expanding the utilization of low-cost substrates by redirecting carbon flux toward erythritol production. Glycerol, an abundant and low-value renewable resource, has recently gained attention as a promising substrate for erythritol fermentation. This study explores its potential to enable cost-effective and sustainable erythritol biosynthesis.

5766	MCA	Whole-Cell Catalytic Synthesis Plant for Sialic Acid	Sialic acid is an important class of functional sugars. Its predominant form is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), a key component of brain gangliosides and the monomeric unit of sialylated oligosaccharides in Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs). In this project, we employ Escherichia coli to co-express the enzymes AGE (N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase) and NAL (N-acetylneuraminate lyase). To address issues of substrate-product flux balance and inter-enzyme mass transfer during the dual-enzyme catalytic process, we will assemble AGE and NAL into multi-enzyme complexes using either fusion protein technology or protein self-assembly technology. Leveraging the controllability (or tunability) of the self-assembly approach, we will optimize the expression ratio of the enzymes within the complexes to achieve highly efficient synthesis of sialic acid.

The recognition core utilizes a ligand-binding oligo (LBO) that undergoes a specific structural change upon antibiotic binding, releasing a short release oligo (SRO). For signal amplification, we design two distinct strategies to suit various application needs: a T7 in vitro transcription system, where the SRO triggers the production of a fluorescent RNA aptamer, and a CRISPR-Cas12a system, where the SRO activates Cas12a's trans-cleavage activity to degrade a fluorescent reporter. This dual-approach system enables highly amplified and quantifiable detection of antibiotic residues.

5773	Korea-HS	Fruit Peel Degradation Using Engineered Lactobacillus reuteri Expressing Polygalacturonase (PGXc)	Fruit peel waste is a significant component of agricultural biomass, yet its rich pectin content remains underutilized. To address this, we engineered Lactobacillus reuteri, a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) probiotic, to secrete polygalacturonase (pgxC) for extracellular pectin degradation. Using the pTRKH3 backbone under the ermB promoter and fused with the Usp45 secretion signal, we achieved stable expression and secretion of pgxC. Transformation in E. coli and L. reuteri confirmed plasmid maintenance, while SDS-PAGE revealed a distinct 48.5 kDa pgxC band. Protein quantification indicated increased secretion in engineered strains (0.10 vs 0.04 µg/µL controls). Functional assays validated pgxC activity: engineered L. reuteri released significantly greater amounts of D-galacturonic acid from pectin, with degradation efficiencies varying across fruit sources (pear and tomato > kiwi > banana > watermelon). This work demonstrates probiotic-mediated fruit peel valorization and highlights applications in biofuels, feed, and prebiotic production through a sustainable waste-to-resource platform.

5774	UTDallas	Stress Protection of mRNA with Tardigrade IDPs for Vaccine Stability Applications	Tardigrades are extremophiles capable of surviving desiccation, freezing, and irradiation, owing to unique intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that protect cells and biomolecules under stress. As mRNA vaccines become increasingly important, protecting these fragile molecules from degradation is crucial, particularly given the expense and inequity associated with cold chain storage systems. To harness tardigrade resilience, we synthetically engineered ten IDP genes from Ramazzottius varieornatus and Hypsibius exemplaris and expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. As a proof of concept, these proteins will be combined with mRNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and subjected to variations in temperature and heating. GFP mRNA integrity and translational capacity will be assessed in using gel electrophoresis. Demonstrating mRNA protection could enable tardigrade IDP-based stabilization of vaccines, reducing cold chain dependence and improving global vaccine accessibility.

5780	Vilnius-Lithuania	IXPOSE: unlocking DNA detection potential of TIGR-Tas	Lithuania is a hotspot in Europe for tick-borne diseases, with thousands of people exposed to Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis annually. However, despite awareness of these common infections, a significant gap remains: we lack vital data on other pathogens circulating in wild tick populations. This missing information forces researchers, doctors, and public health officials to make educated guesses. To address this, we present a breakthrough solution using TIGR-Tas--a novel RNA-guided, DNA-targeting system. Unlike CRISPR-Cas, TIGR-Tas operates in a PAM-independent manner, expanding the range of detectable DNA sequences. By integrating TIGR-Tas with lateral flow assays and isothermal DNA amplification methods such as RPA, it becomes a powerful, field-ready diagnostic tool. With this system, we aim to uncover the hidden diversity of tick-borne pathogens, empowering healthcare, enhancing prevention, advancing research, and protecting communities throughout Lithuania and beyond.

5782	HS-KY	Insights into Molecular Interactions ? Predicting and Validating PFOA Binding to Human Proteins	"PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are chemicals used in several manufactured products. They have been called ""forever chemicals"" for their inability to break down in our environment and have accumulated to an extent that at least 97% of Americans have traceable amounts in their blood (NHANES 2015). However, while the full spectrum of their effects is not entirely understood, they have been implicated in several cancers and liver conditions. Current detection methods like mass spectrometry and liquid or gas chromatography are expensive and inaccessible to the general public. Our project aims to develop a cost-effective protein-based detection system for PFAS. Using a reverse-screening approach across multiple protein-ligand databases, we identified candidate human proteins predicted to bind perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a representative PFAS.

The first design uses a whole-cell E. coli sensor featuring a chimeric histidine kinase combining MxaY (from Paracoccus denitrificans) with CusS (from E. coli), activating a kinase phosphorylation pathway to express a visible blue chromoprotein (AmilCP) in response to methanol. The second design employs a Ca²?-PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) from Methylorubrum extorquens, expressed and isolated from E. coli to create a cell-free system. MDH oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde, detectable via colorimetric assays. Both biosensors offer scalable, specific, and visual detection of hazardous methanol levels in beverages.

5788	UNC-ChapelHill	Fluoro-free: A Probiotic to Capture and Remove Harmful PFAS from the GI Tract	Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic contaminants that bioaccumulate and are associated with adverse health effects. While remediation efforts target environmental cleanup, strategies to lower PFAS levels within the human body remain limited. We propose a probiotic-based therapeutic approach using engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to sequester PFAS in the gastrointestinal tract. By capturing PFAS before absorption, EcN could reduce systemic exposure and enhance excretion. Our hypothesis is that bacterial PFAS uptake is primarily transporter-mediated. To maximize intracellular retention, we disrupted the TolC-AcrB efflux system. As a proof of concept, we inhibited AcrB using small molecule inhibitor Phenylalanine-Arginine Beta-Naphthylamide. Subsequently, we created a stable AcrB knockout via recA-mediated recombination.This work lays the foundation for probiotic therapeutics targeting PFAS exposure. Beyond the lab, we advance public outreach initiatives to educate and raise PFAS awareness and promote STEM accessibility in our community.

To precisely regulate SAM in cirrhosis, we engineered a SAM-responsive aptazyme, ReguSAMe, by fusing a SAM riboswitch to the HDV ribozyme followed by multicycle evolution. By embedding ReguSAMe into the 3'UTR of MAT1A mRNA, we established a negative feedback circuit for SAM homeostasis in hepatocytes. it expresses MAT1A to synthesize SAM when levels are low and self-cleaves to terminate expression when levels normalize. This precise control offers a promising therapeutic strategy with reduced side effects.

5790	DEPU	A Pichia pastoris factory for efficient production of lipase	"With the intensification of the energy crisis and the rising demand for environmental protection, biodiesel, as a clean energy source, has attracted much attention. Every year, our country generates hundreds of millions of tons of waste oils such as used cooking oil. If not handled properly, it may cause food safety and environmental risks. The traditional chemical method for producing biodiesel has problems such as high energy consumption and pollution; while the biological enzyme method, with advantages like environmental friendliness and mild conditions, has become a new direction, but it also has disadvantages such as low enzyme activity and high cost. This project aims to improve the reaction efficiency and stability of the biological enzyme method, converting waste oils into environmentally friendly biodiesel, contributing to the ""dual carbon"" goal, promoting the transformation of the energy structure and sustainable development."

5791	ZQT-Nanjing	KINETiC: Kynurenine-depleting Immuno-reversal Network in E. coli for Therapy in Colorectal cancer	Our project is expected to provide a new idea and method for cancer treatment. In recent years, kynureninase (KYNase) has gradually attracted extensive attention in the field of cancer immunotherapy. We utilized synthetic biology methods and engineered bacteria to express KY Nase, regulating the metabolism of the KP pathway within tumor cells, consuming its downstream metabolite Kyn. This inhibits tumor immune escape, enhances the host's immune system response, and achieves tumor cell death. We utilized Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as the chassis cell and the hypoxic and high-lactic-acid regulatory ALPaGA subsystem as promoter, to express KYNase in the tumor microenvironment. We also made semi-rational modifications to KYNase, hoping to obtain an enzyme with better catalytic effect. We designed and built a PhiX174E lysis protein module to release KYNase extracellularly at the right time. For biosafety, we designed a suicide switch to prevent engineered strains from being released into the environment.

5792	TU-Eindhoven	BRIGHT: Bile Acid Responsive Indicator for Gut Health Tracking	Chronic diarrhea affects millions worldwide, yet its underlying causes often remain undiagnosed due to the lack of accessible diagnostic tools. One of the most overlooked conditions is Bile Acid Malabsorption (BAM), a disorder in which excess bile acids reach the colon, leading to persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, and impaired quality of life. Current diagnostic methods for BAM are either too invasive, expensive, or impractical for routine clinical use, resulting in long diagnostic delays and misclassification as irritable bowel syndrome. To address this gap, we developed BRIGHT, a novel bioluminescent biosensor that detects bile acids in stool samples. BRIGHT provides a simple, fast, and affordable readout that can be quantified with a smartphone camera, opening the door to a home based point-of-care test. By lowering barriers for both patients and clinicians, BRIGHT aims to empower individuals, accelerate diagnosis, and pave the way toward improved treatment outcomes.

5794	ABOA	VeriFied	Forensic science is a field that lacks reliable methods for determining the age of bloodstains, a key factor in reconstructing timelines for crimes. To address this issue, in our project we are developing an innovative, on-site forensic investigation tool - VeriFied - that allows crime scene investigators to quickly and reliably assess the age of bloodstains. The method is based on an enzyme fragment complementation assay that produces a bioluminescence signal. The signal intensity correlates with the levels of oxidized albumin that increase over time as bloodstains are exposed to air. Our aim is to introduce a scientifically robust, quantitative method that reduces reliance on individual interpretation and improves the accuracy of investigation done at a crime scene. This enables criminal investigators to establish more precise timelines and identify relevant bloodstains to the case, guiding the investigation with a scientific basis and solving crimes that would have previously gone unsolved.

5795	Utrecht	GutFeeling: Fishing for Solutions	Chronic diseases often require lifelong medication, yet poor adherence remains a major barrier to effective treatment. This leads to increased mortality, higher healthcare costs, and reduced quality of life. In Parkinsons disease lack of adherence is caused by the symptoms of the disease, like memory loss and dyskinesia. Therefore, we propose the development of a self-sustaining drug delivery platform using engineered commensal gut bacteria. As a proof of concept, we aim to modify Pseudomonas alcaligenes to autonomously produce and secrete L-DOPA within the gut. To validate the constructs we used fluorescent reporter proteins and L-DOPA biosynthesis. To visualize P. alcaligenes colonization, protein expression and secretion we will use its host: zebrafish. To test our bacteria in a mammalian system we used a gut transwell system. We envision that our project contributes to a living microbial biofactory approach to drug delivery, reducing the need for continuous self-administration.

In project LATCH, we aimed to improve antifungal therapy by engineering Bacillus subtilis, a generally non-pathogenic human commensal with natural antifungal properties, to target C. albicans. By expressing chitinase and SP1 on its membrane via a linking sequence, B. subtilis can bind to chitin on the fungal surface, increasing local antifungal concentration. Computational modeling guided adhesion dynamics, binding specificity, and expression optimization. Although only the plasmid design was verified and no binding data obtained, the project provided valuable insights and inspired local education on fungal infections and synthetic biology through outreach in Gothenburg.

5798	UAlberta	AshBloom: A rhamnolipid-derived foam offering a sustainable, non-toxic alternative to traditional firefighting solutions.	Wildfires in Canada's boreal forests are increasing in frequency and severity, creating landscapes that struggle to recover. Current wildfire suppression uses plain water or chemical foams that prioritize flame control but overlook ecological impacts. Class A foams, commonly used in wildland firefighting, are petrochemical-based, produced via non-sustainable processes, and harm soil and aquatic health. Ammonium-based retardants also disrupt seed germination and microbial communities, with potential nutrient runoff risks. AshBloom presents an eco-friendly alternative: a bio-based, biodegradable fire-suppressant foam made from microbial rhamnolipids via sustainable fermentation. This foam matches the performance of traditional products while enhancing post-fire soil function by promoting water infiltration, beneficial microbes, and seed germination. Being made from renewable feedstocks like waste cooking oil, it rapidly degrades without toxic residues. AshBloom supports both fire suppression and ecological restoration, offering a tool that helps landscapes regenerate sustainably and aids firefighters and forest managers in protecting ecosystems with nature-aligned technology.

5801	Queens-Canada	Foundations for an AHL-Responsive Genetic Circuit in Eukaryotic Cells: A Biofilm-Disrupting Therapeutic	Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms drive chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) by resisting antibiotics and immune clearance. Biofilm development is regulated by quorum sensing (QS) via acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), making QS an appealing therapeutic target. While AHL detection has been engineered in bacteria, its use in eukaryotic systems remains unexplored. We developed early-stage eukaryotic genetic circuits linking AHL sensing to gene expression using chimeric LasR and RhlR receptors. In silico docking (HADDOCK) guided variant selection based on ligand binding and dimerization stability. Complementary biofilm assays using AiiA lactonase, alginate lyase, and ?-amylase demonstrated measureable inhibition of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms. Together, these results lay the groundwork for AHL-responsive genetic circuits in mammalian cells, supporting future synthetic biology-based therapies where engineered immune cells could detect bacterial QS signals and secrete biofilm-degrading enzymes for targeted CF treatment.

5802	Stanford	LiRA - A dual-input RNA logic system for precise detection and treatment of HBV-driven HCC.	Most cancer treatments, from chemotherapy to targeted inhibitors, act systemically, killing cancer cells but also damaging healthy ones. This is due to a central problem in oncology: few cancers have a single biomarker both unique and abundant enough to be safely used as a therapeutic trigger. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially when driven by hepatitis B virus (HBV), exemplifies this challenge. Markers such as GPC3, AKR1B10, and RP11 are elevated in tumors but also appear in healthy tissues, making single-signal therapies inherently risky. LiRA overcomes this through a programmable intracellular RNA logic gate inspired by Boolean computation. Built on the RADAR technology, LiRA activates only when two biomarker transcripts are detected together within the same cell, ensuring precise activation. In HEK293T, LiRA sensors achieved up to 23-fold activation and demonstrated strict AND-gate behavior. By replacing reporters with a therapeutic output, LiRA allows for targeted treatment, paving the way for next-generation therapeutics.

The accumulation of PAHs can pose huge threats to the water bodies. According to Guangzhou WWTP, the concentration of several PAHs in local effluent, even after wastewater treatment, still remained approximately 10 to 15 times above China's acceptable risk levels. Due to the numerous drawbacks of the existing approaches, such as low efficiency and significant side effects, we come up with a more comprehensive solution to this problem: constructing an engineered E.coli which is integrated with plasmids containing diverse gene clusters, endowing it with higher degradation capability, enhanced environmental resistance, and safer switch control. The goal of the project is to provide a safer and more efficient mean of treating PAHs.

5805	Tsinghua-M	yeast SMART?yeast Synthetic Modulatory Adaptation for stress Resistant based on TCM?	"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) employs ""pulse diagnosis"" to identify bodily imbalance via dynamic patterns--such as the speed, strength, and rhythm of the wrist pulse--and facilitate precise interventions. Industrial yeast cell factories also encounter intermittent, multi-source stresses analogous to physiological imbalances in human body, yet they lack a pulse-diagnosis-like technique to pinpoint stress disturbances and implement tailored regulation. Such stresses reduce product yield and compromise batch stability, becoming a major bottleneck for large-scale production. Inspired by TCM, we propose visualizing the spatiotemporal responses of yeast strains as ""stress pulse patterns,"" and designing targeted genetic regulatory modules accordingly. Specifically, we developed a tripartite genetic oscillator that transforms stress inputs into quantifiable ""fluorescent pulses"" (to analyze stress sources/intensities) and paired it with a toolkit of multi-stress resistance genetic elements and a pulse regulation strategy. This low-metabolic-burden, customizable platform enables dynamic diagnosis and precise regulation in fermentation, boosting process robustness and efficiency."

5808	SCU-BSE-China	RareAmine Forge: Engineering ThermoFactories for Specialized Polyamines	This project establishes a thermotolerant microbial platform for the biosynthesis of specialized polyamines--long-chain and branched molecules with significant potential in medicine, agriculture, and advanced materials. The workflow began with collecting hot spring samples across a temperature gradient. Metagenomic analysis confirmed temperature as a core driver of microbial community structure and function, revealing a significant enrichment of polyamine synthesis pathways, especially spermidine synthase, which enabled the mining of key synthase genes. Subsequent multi-omics analysis of isolated thermophilic Bacillus strains under temperature stress revealed a coordinated cellular adaptation strategy involving metabolic reprogramming, protein homeostasis, and membrane regulation. Morphological analysis visually confirmed these adaptations. Crucially, polyamine biosynthesis pathways were consistently upregulated under heat stress, underscoring their integral role in thermotolerance. This project successfully validated native thermotolerant Bacillus as an ideal chassis, decoded the mechanisms of heat resistance and polyamine biosynthesis, and identified key synthetic biology elements. Future research will focus on developing synthetic biology tools for this chassis, genetically engineering the strain to optimize the production of target polyamines via modular pathway assembly and flux optimization, and expanding the portfolio of accessible bioactive polyamines by discovering novel enzymes from the established platforms.

To address this, we designed an expression system that enables spatially and temporally controlled, high-yield vaccine production by combining the replication mechanism of the Tobacco Yellow Dwarf Virus (TYDV) with the salt-inducible promoter pPdDREG1B for the controlled expression of the DENV-2 envelope protein subunit domain III (EDIII). To expand our repertoire of salt-inducible promoters, we developed NiSPOT, a software tool that classifies and identifies promoters inducible by various stressors, including salt stress. The vaccine protein was optimized using an ESM2-based mutagenesis model to enhance stability. Construct assembly was performed using Golden Gate Assembly and verified via Oxford Nanopore sequencing, followed by transient expression in Nicotiana tabacum through Agrobacterium-mediated agroinfiltration. This system enables precise, inducible control of vaccine protein production in plants.

5812	LZU-GANSU	Oral Health Guardian: Engineered Lactobacillus for Real-Time Monitoring of Dental Caries and Biofilm Removal	Dental caries is the most common oral disease, with an incidence rate exceeding 70% in the population. The biofilm of dental plaque, formed by Streptococcus mutans (S.m.) and other bacteria, minerals, and food debris through co-aggregation adhesion, is the main culprit in the development of caries. It is particularly concerning that due to a lack of oral health education, the public often fails to recognize the early symptoms of caries. Early caries in hidden areas are even harder to detect, exacerbating the problem. To address these issues, our team has designed a biological system capable of locating and eliminating high-risk plaque biofilms. Specifically, we've integrated the signal reception module of the quorum sensing system, Com system, from S.m. into probiotics (Lactobacilli), creating engineered bacteria. Additionally, we've developed a unique signal amplification system. When the co-aggregated engineered bacteria within the biofilm receive virulence signals from S.m., they trigger the expression of fluorescent proteins and antimicrobial peptides, thereby enabling the localization and elimination of plaque.

Although they are currently most prominent in tropical countries, outside travelers can get back home with the disease. Diagnosis is still challenging due to the genetic similarity among Zika (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV), and Chikungunya (CHKV), which cause similar symptoms (fever, muscle pain), and current serological assays are non-specific, significantly hindering proper patient treatment and effective epidemiological control. In this project, by utilizing synthetic biology, we will eliminate the non-specific interactions that cause cross-reactivity in current serological tests. The design of DiagSyn integrates bioinformatics-driven epitope selection with rational linker design, together with the use of structural biology and molecular dynamics tools, to generate diagnostic antigens that accurately reflect the circulating strains while excluding conserved cross-reactive sequences, enabling highly specific detection.

5814	NYC-Empire-State	VERDE	Soilless agriculture has been an agricultural market on the rise, which yields up to 50% higher efficiency than soil-based cultivation. VERDE is an antifungal detector that works against fusarium, a common fungus that causes fungal root rot, which poses a significant threat to soilless agriculture. To enhance the specificity of detection and mitigate the scale constraints, VERDE engineers plasmid of E.coli detects low acidity below 4.5 and indicates the infection of Fusarium. The acid-inducible E. coli asr promoter drives co-expression of genes glutaminase (glsA), ?-1-3 glucanase (BGL2), and RsAFP2. These variants in the assembly allows the biosensor to not only detect the presence of Fusarium, but also facilitates its death by producing proteins that disrupts the diffusion of Fusarium: BGL2 and RsAFP2.

5815	HKGTC	AQus-HIM - A Quorum-Sensing Biosensor Kit For Hunting Invisible Microplastics	Identification of microplastics in complex environmental matrices remains a challenge. In this study, we engineered a whole-cell biosensor based on the quorum sensing regulatory circuit LasI-LasR in P. aeruginosa with a reporting module that expressed a LacZ gene. The results demonstrated that our engineered biosensor pSB1C3-LasR-pLasR3-LacZ was highly sensitive to the AHLs with EC50 values as low as 1.0 X 10-8M with N-3-oxo-decanoyl L-homoserine lactone (C10-HSL) and 3.2 X 10-8M with N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl L-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) upon 2 h incubation. The values lie within the average range of AHL concentrations in water environments. Besides, the engineered biosensor is found to be functional in the real tap water environment and seawater without significant matrix effect. In addition, we engineered negative control biosensors by removing the sensing module to reduce background expression of ?-galactosidase activity. Moreover, we developed protocol of quantitative X-gal assay which can be used as a testing kit.

5816	Baltimore-BioCrew	TRIAGNOSTICS: Spotting Remission is our Mission	Breast cancer incidence is rising, primarily in women under 44. Despite being 10% of breast cancer cases, TNBC, a rare and aggressive form, has a higher rate of death (40% of breast cancer-related deaths) and recurrence (~40% of patients) compared to other breast cancers. The absence of progesterone, estrogen, and HER2 receptors means that traditional therapies are ineffective against TNBC. Patients have the best prognosis if the disease is diagnosed early, so to help detect TNBC recurrence, our team is creating a reusable, efficient, and accessible detector system. Our simple liquid biopsy test has a TNBC patient in remission pricks their finger and apply a droplet of blood to a tube with a simple detection device. In the presence of miRNAs 21 and 155 that are indicative of TNBC, toehold switches allow translation of a fluorescent reporter. Our device will be a significant step forward for at-home diagnostic tools.

5817	MSP-Maastricht	CoreSpin: Modified Spidroin Proteins as Thermally Conductive Biomaterials for Heat Exchanger Enhancement	Heat exchanger biofouling drives global energy usage and greenhouse-gas emissions. Found in essential infrastructure, heat exchangers contain thermally conductive copper plates prone to biofilm formation, which reduces thermal conductivity by up to 98%, increasing energy consumption. Our solution entails coating copper plates with modified spider silk proteins, produced in E. coli, which maintain plate conductivity and repel bacterial adhesion through their nanostructure. Crystalline ?-sheets, flagged by amorphous terminal domains, confer high tensile strength and thermal conductivity to spidroins. ?-sheets were modified to maximise thermal conductivity by increasing size. Terminal domains were modified for copper adhesion through addition of cysteine residues. Protein expression was confirmed with fluorescence imaging, and tested by mass determination and sequencing via LC-MS. Copper adhesion and resulting nanostructure were tested with SEM imaging and ATR-FTIR analysis. This research demonstrates spidroin potential beyond biomedical contexts, providing a sustainable, energy-efficient coating contributing to a cleaner climate and sustainable economy.

5818	SCAU Guangzhou	High-Folate Soybeans - Designing the Next Generation of Folate-fortified Crops	Folate is a vitamin that functions in DNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and various biosynthetic pathways. Folate deficiency is directly associated with diseases like neural tube defects, megaloblastic anemia, cleft lip and palate. Globally, folate deficiency has become a serious public health problem. Industrially synthesized folic acid has poor metabolic efficiency, and the synthesis process causes serious environmental pollution. However, plant folate has high active derivatives, good absorption efficiency, and is sustainable. Therefore, the most effective way to supplement folate is food fortification. This project proposes a scheme for creating high-folate soybeans by integrating biosynthetic elements. Four key folate synthetases were over-expressed in soybean seeds. HPLC-MS detection showed that the enzyme HDFR can double the content of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, the active folate component, which is good for people with genetic defects. Our project has successfully achieved expected goals and exerted extensive impacts in scientific research and society.

While transcriptional and translational regulation provide powerful means of control in mammalian cells, post-translational regulation offers distinct advantages by enabling immediate and reversible responses to external stimuli. Here, we present SPARK (Signal-Programmable Activation of Regulated seCretion), which employs engineered molecular anchors to tether secretory vesicles carrying the target protein to the actin cytoskeleton and release them upon signal induction through protein dissociation or cleavage. We demonstrated that SPARK enabled efficient light- and chemically induced secretion of reporter proteins in HEK293T cells, exhibiting a markedly faster response than traditional transcriptional control systems. This platform provides rapid, tunable, and precise control of protein secretion, establishing a versatile foundation for on-demand therapeutic protein production and other applications that require fast and programmable protein release.

5820	HS-Alpha	BioScent: Transforming Lignin Waste into Vanillin through Synthetic Biology	Our daily lives depend heavily on paper, yet its production and recycling processes inevitably lead to significant lignin waste. We aimed to harness synthetic biology to transform these wasted resources into valuable products. After extensive consultations with experts in policy, industry, and experimental technologies, we engineered Escherichia coli to convert ferulic acid--a representative lignin degradation product--into high-value compounds. We first demonstrated that E. coli could be adapted, via laboratory-accelerated adaptive evolution, to tolerate simulated lignin degradation liquor. Subsequently, by introducing two key enzymes, CtFCS and CUS, into E. coli, we successfully achieved the bioconversion of ferulic acid into vanillin. Our approach features modularity, transferability, and cost efficiency, making it not only technically feasible but also highly promising for practical application. It highlights the potential of engineered microbes as green and efficient tools for resource recovery, contributing meaningfully to the advancement of circular bioeconomy and sustainable development.

5822	ZZU-China	ExoAPT-CRISPR: A Targeted Detection Platform for Breast Cancer Exosome Biomarkers	To enable early liquid biopsy for breast cancer, this project developed ExoAPT-CRISPR, an ultra-sensitive and specific integrated detection platform targeting four exosomal proteins (HER-2, PD-L1, MMP-9, EPCAM). The modular platform integrates exosome capture with multistage signal amplification. Magnetic beads conjugated with CD63-specific aptamers achieve efficient, broad-spectrum exosome isolation. Highly active Cas14a protein is expressed and purified via a prokaryotic system, serving as the core detection enzyme. Two isothermal amplification modules, Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) and Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA), are designed for each target, converting protein binding events into amplified DNA products. These products function as trigger signals: HCR activates the Cas12a-crRNA complex, while RCA activates the Cas14a-sgRNA complex, enabling reporter cleavage and robust fluorescence generation. This strategy achieves precise molecular recognition and signal conversion, providing an innovative, clinically applicable solution for early breast cancer diagnosis and prognostic monitoring.

5829	Stuttgart	ARALEX - Autocatalyst Recycling via Advanced Leaching Extraction using oXalate	Platinum-group metals (PGMs) are critical resources with low recycling rates due to environmentally hazardous and costly conventional leaching processes that rely on harsh chemicals. This project presents an innovative, sustainable approach to PGM recycling using oxalate as a green leaching agent. Our interdisciplinary method combines biotechnological and chemical strategies: genetically modified Corynebacterium glutamicum is engineered to produce and export oxalate into the extracellular environment, providing a biological source of the leaching agent. The chemical process involves dissolving catalyst residues in water, adding the biologically produced oxalate to form PGM-oxalate complexes, and isolating these complexes through water evaporation. This novel biotechnological-chemical approach offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional PGM recycling methods, potentially increasing recovery rates while reducing environmental impact. The integration of synthetic biology with green chemistry principles demonstrates a promising pathway toward sustainable critical metal recovery from exhausted automotive catalysts.

5845	GXU-China	Antibacterial Blue Light Therapy for Gastric Cancer	"To combat Helicobacter pylori antibiotic resistance and gastric cancer, we developed an engineered living therapeutic platform. It uses an attenuated H. pylori chassis with natural gastric targeting, integrating luminescence, quorum sensing, and bio-safety modules. Surface-loaded with Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and a lux operon, the bacteria are activated by near-infrared light to generate reactive oxygen species and blue-light phototoxicity, inducing tumor cell apoptosis. A quorum-sensing circuit triggers light emission at a high population density, activating endogenous porphyrins in wild-type H. pylori for a ""bystander killing"" effect, which also self-regulates the engineered population. For bio-safety, a hypoxia-responsive suicide switch ensures bacterial survival in the stomach but causes programmed death in oxygenated environments. Encapsulated in an oral liposomal delivery system, this platform offers a novel paradigm for overcoming antibiotic resistance and achieving precision gastric cancer therapy."

CAU-China 2025 builds PhAgri, a SMART phage-like particle (PLP) platform?it can precisely target and kill pathogenic bacteria without accidentally harming other. Meanwhile, since PhAgri has no self-replication ability, its safety is effectively guaranteed. Using E. coli MG1655, we developed a delivery system, tail fiber replacement platform, and Alphage software for flexible antibacterial spectrum reprogramming. We hope that when PhAgri moves beyond the laboratory, it can be cultivated and used independently by farmers. By providing them with eco-friendly and highly effective pesticides, PhAgri will align with multiple Sustainable Development Goals. In the future, we anticipate that PhAgri will not only safeguard food security, but also enable the synthesis of artificially designed bacteriophages through predictive modification of tail fiber proteins--ultimately solving all potential bacterial problems.

5847	NMU-China	Enteroplastivore	With the widespread use of plastic products, a large amount of plastic waste gradually decomposes and breaks down, forming plastic fragments with a diameter of less than 5 millimeters, namely microplastics. Microplastics are difficult to decompose naturally and gradually accumulate in the human body. Microplastics can cause imbalance in the intestinal flora, trigger systemic inflammatory responses, and even potentially lead to tumors and cancers. Regarding the issue of how to remove microplastics from the human body, our team proposed to construct a symbiotic system of lactic acid bacteria and yeast, which secretes degrading enzymes to degrade the microplastic particles in the intestinal tract. In addition, this system can also regulate the balance of intestinal flora, enhance the intestinal barrier function, and reduce the oxidative stress caused by microplastics through antioxidant effects, thereby minimizing the possible damage to the body caused by microplastics.

5849	UiOslo-Norway	The development of a proof of concept for a continuous lactate monitor	Our aim is to develop a wearable biosensor that continuously monitors lactate concentration in the interstitial fluid. The current method to measure lactate levels widely used by professional athletes requires blood sampling through invasive needles and the use of disposable strips, disrupting training flow. Building on the success of continuous glucose monitors, our device will embed lactate?oxidizing enzymes (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase) within a microneedle array to catalyze lactate in dermal interstitial fluid into pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide. An integrated electrode will then oxidize the generated hydrogen peroxide, producing electrons whose current correlates directly with lactate concentration. By tracking these electrical signals in real time, athletes can optimize training and recovery on the run while reducing recurring costs and biological waste. During our project, we have expressed and immobilized the enzyme and verified them through electrochemical detection techniques to present a proof on concept.

Subsequently, these two products are assembled via supramolecular host-guest interactions to form a novel PPA-CD supramolecular phosphorescent material. This entire process operates under mild conditions, achieving the green and high-value valorization of two low-value waste streams into a functional material. It pioneers the simultaneous integration of plastic and food waste within a single system, offering a new pathway for sustainable material development and waste resource utilization.

5856	McMaster-Canada	REACT - A Highly Sensitive Aptamer Based Biosensor for the Detection of Renal Distress	Globally, 15% of all kidney transplants face acute rejection, often before symptoms are noticeable. Contemporary detection methods are often done too late and face tradeoffs between invasiveness, accuracy, portability, and cost-effectiveness. We present REACT, a portable and highly sensitive point of care diagnostic for the early-onset detection of kidney rejection. REACT senses two known biomarkers of kidney distress, NGAL and CXCL-9, and uses Rolling Circle Amplification to boost signal output. A G4 DNAzyme functionalized on a reduced Graphene Oxide surface coupled with paper microfluidics allows for a multiplexed colorimetric detection, facilitated by our smartphone app to quantify and interpret the readout. Given the portable nature of REACT, users can use it outside of a hospital setting, allowing for early at-home detection of kidney rejection. This shortens the length of post-transplant hospital stay and decreases the risk of complications resulting from an untreated rejection.

Here, we present ECLIPSE (Enzymatic Control using Logic-Based Inducible Promoter System Engineering), a genetic framework that integrates multi-layered regulation with synthetic enzymology. We combine inducible repressor-operator systems with CRISPRi-based dCas9-sgRNA repression to achieve both conditional ON/OFF switching and fine-tuned, graded control of gene expression respectively. We also optimised our effector enzyme through two complementary approaches - host optimization and rational mutagenesis. We then apply this framework to treat hypercholesterolemia, engineering E. coli Nissle to express ECOP170 for the in-situ breakdown of dietary cholesterol. Our probiotic platform thereby acts as a proof-of-concept that bridges precise genetic regulation with optimized enzymatic function, offering a generalizable strategy for designing programmable and robust systems.

5861	SMBU	Hepzero: supressing the expression of HBV genes	254 million people are living with chronic HBV. Every thirty seconds, HBV silently takes one life. A vaccine exists, and it works. But what about people already living with HBV? For them, there is no cure. The reason lies in a molecular structure called cccDNA, it can persist for years in the nucleus and is untouched by immune responses or existing therapies. This persistence is what makes HBV so difficult to cure. But we've engineered a system to change that. Hepzero is a dual-CRISPR design that targets cccDNA. Two engineered guide RNAs pair through a kissing loop to bring two dCas proteins to key regulatory regions. These RNA-RNA interactions greatly increase the chance of precise, simultaneous binding, enabling safer repression of viral activity. In this way, we block HBV gene expression and replication without cutting DNA, leaving the host genome unharmed, aiming for a one?time intervention rather than life?long therapy.

We focus on Snodgrassella alvi, a natural and stable gut symbiont, and engineer it using recombinant DNA methods to carry the organophosphate degradation (opd) gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that breaks down toxic pesticides into harmless byproducts, reducing their deadly impact on bees. Through Golden Gate Assembly and electroporation, we introduce this genetic circuit into S. alvi, creating a living pesticide-detoxifying partner. Unlike external treatments, this microbial ally persists inside the bee, spreads throughout the hive, and transfers engineered traits to offspring microbiomes, extending protection across generations. SynBeeGee offers a sustainable, self-sustaining defense for pollinators, agriculture, and the ecosystems we all depend on.

5869	ZJU-China	LumaManta: a one-stop, continuous, spatiotemporal aquatic information-detecting device for ecological system.	To better PROTECT, we must first DETECT. LumaManta, developed by ZJU-China, is an all-in-one bio-intelligent underwater device for continuous spatiotemporal detection and treatment of aquatic environments. Aiming to advance environmental conservation, it integrates four biological modules--Detection, aTF Production, Treatment, and Algae-Bacteria Symbiosis--within a manta-ray-inspired body to achieve autonomous ecosystem monitoring. The Detection Module employs a cell-free biosensing system using DNA strand displacement, and PSR amplification to detect metal ions, biomolecules, and eDNA in real time. The aTF Production Module applies AI-assisted protein reprogramming to expand sensing specificity, while the Treatment Module uses protein scaffolds for pollutant absorption and molecular collection. The Symbiosis System maintains a cyanobacteria-E. coli co-culture for CO? fixation and nutrient cycling, enabling sustainable, long-term operation. LumaManta represents a new paradigm for bio-driven conservation technology--turning detection into the first step toward sustainable protection of aquatic life.

5870	Peking	HpBusters: Engineered Probiotic Yeast Equipped with the Target-Adhere-Eradicate System	Halitosis, nausea, and bloating--these are discomforts that people with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection suffer from every day. As the culprit of chronic gastric diseases, Hp has infected over half of the global population. In 2025, integrating probiotic engineering with micromotor delivery, the Peking team constructed HpBusters. The sensing-and-therapy system and the adhesion system were designed and implemented in genetically modified Saccharomyces boulardii to sense the biomarker N?-methylhistamine, and while adhered to Hp, to secrete the biofilm-degrading enzyme AiiA. Micromotors, based on calcium carbonate, propel the encapsulating pH-responsive microgels through the gastric mucus barrier, releasing probiotics directly at infection sites. Models were established to comprehensively evaluate and simulate the efficiency of HpBusters across all processes. Human practices were conducted to forge connections between our project and society. We hope this antibiotic-free strategy enables targeted reaction, biofilm eradication and long-term protection, offering Hp-infected patients a comfortable yet effective therapeutic alternative.

5871	Benenden Guangzhou	Healing Fish Hearts with Leech Medicine	Heart disease is the number one cause of death in humans. But fish can also suffer from heart problems-especially in fish farms, where sick fish often go unnoticed. Many fish die from blood clots inside their bodies, and farmers cannot easily tell what caused it. Our team is studying a special molecule called hirudin, which comes from leeches. Hirudin stops blood from clotting and has been used to treat human heart disease for over 100 years. We want to know: can hirudin also help fish? We Identified hirudin genes from 12 types of leeches. We then converted these genes into genetic parts that can be used by all iGEM teams to do research on. Our own research shows that synthetic hirudin from these genes have the potential to help fish live longer and healthier lives in farms. We hope it will improve fish farming around the world.

Current diagnostic methods provide only a single-timepoint assessment, failing to capture the dynamic fluctuations of the vaginal microbiome. To address this gap, we propose a longitudinal monitoring approach that enables daily sampling and trend analysis. Our prototype integrates two key sensing modalities: a biosensor that detects putrescine, a biological amine associated with BV, and an optical pH sensor that provides complementary information about overall vaginal health. By tracking these biomarkers over time, we aim to generate a data-driven and personalized model of vaginal health, offering users deeper insight into microbiome dynamics and earlier detection of vaginal dysbiosis.

5880	NAWI Graz Austria	Knotaut - Combating the spread of Japanese knotweed by hijacking its RNAi-pathway	Reynoutria japonica, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a fast growing and propagating neophyte present in most of Europe, North America and New Zealand that poses a severe risk to local ecosystems and communities. While this invasive plant species is generally susceptible to chemical-herbicidal-agents and physical control methods, both come with 3 key drawbacks. They are either unable to guarantee long term removal, damage surrounding ecosystems or are highly cost, time and/or labor intensive. Using a modified Escherichia coli strain and a specifically designed dsRNA expression system our goal was to produce dsRNA that is able to post-transcriptionally silence essential genes of R. japonica, ultimately leading to plant death. Additionally, dsRNA encapsulation into liposomes enhances its environmental stability as well as its uptake into and distribution in the plant. Our work had one clear objective: Create an environmentally friendly, species-specific herbicide formulation with dsRNA as its active ingredient - Knotaut!

Conventional biosynthesis requires two separate bacterial strains, leading to complex processes and substantial waste salt generation. To overcome this, we selected a lysine-producing strain E. coli NT1003 as a basal cell to engineer co-producing cadaverine and succinate from glucose. This enables acid-base neutralization and in situ CO? fixation, minimizing neutralizing agents and waste salt. We constructed genetic switches to regulate lysine decarboxylase (CadA) and optimized CadA for efficient lysine-to-cadaverine conversion. Cofactor engineering further enhanced succinate synthesis. By integrating these modules, we created an intelligent cell factory that simultaneously generates cadaverine and succinate from glucose. This sustainable strategy supports green production of bio-PA, promotes public familiarity with bio-based materials, and encourages greener lifestyles.

5895	SYPHU-CHINA	Lactate-Induced Vector for Engineered Retinoid Supply & Hepatocellular Onco-Therapy	Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastasis has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. This study evaluated All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with FOLFOX4 chemotherapy in a nationwide, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Prior to the clinical trial, AIVC (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cell) modeling predicted that ATRA would induce differentiation of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and reverse chemoresistance. The ATRA+FOLFOX4 cohort showed significantly improved median overall survival (16.2 vs. 10.7 months) and progression-free survival (7.1 vs. 4.2 months) compared to the placebo arm. Experimental validation confirmed that ATRA drives TIC differentiation, remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by repolarizing M2 macrophages to an M1 phenotype, and inhibits PI3K/AKT signaling. This study establishes ATRA+FOLFOX4 as a novel, effective, and safe first-line regimen for advanced HCC, with its mechanism rationally guided by initial AIVC predictions.

5897	UCLouvain	SyntcoLAB	Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are essential bioactive components of breast milk that support infant immunity, cognitive development, and long-term health, yet current infant formulas provide only a small fraction of their natural diversity. To address this gap, we developed a synthetic biology platform using a modular bacterial consortium of Streptococcus thermophilus, a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe), dairy-adapted, and naturally competent chassis. By dividing the HMO biosynthetic pathway among complementary strains, implementing controlled cell aggregation, and establishing metabolic interdependence, we aim to reduce metabolic burden, enhance intermediate sharing, and maintain population balance. This approach is expected to enable the scalable production of a broader spectrum of HMOs than currently available, improving the nutritional quality of formula and establishing a flexible platform for other complex biomolecules.

5901	NCHU	EcoCasein	In recent years, the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock has drawn increasing global attention, particularly methane released during cattle digestion. To address this issue, the NCHU iGEM team developed EcoCasein, a sustainable microbial milk alternative. Our project employs Kluyveromyces marxianus as a host to produce A2 ?-casein, a naturally digestible variant of milk protein, using the PGASO multi-gene assembly system. By introducing carbon-fixation pathways such as the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, we hope to reduce the net carbon footprint of protein production. EcoCasein not only provides a cow-less, easily digestible source of dairy protein but also demonstrates how synthetic biology can contribute to climate-friendly food innovation. Through integrated wet-lab construction, gas analysis, and human practices outreach, our project envisions a new model for sustainable nutrition and low-carbon dairy development.

5902	NNU-CHINA	Empowering MTHFR Mutation Diagnosis for Global Healthcare	Birth defects represent a significant challenge in the field of global public health. Among the contributing factors, folic acid deficiency is one of the primary preventable causes. These defects not only endanger individual health but also impose a heavy burden on healthcare systems and society. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical enzyme in the folic acid metabolic pathway. Mutations in the MTHFR gene can impair folic acid metabolism, increasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage and fetal malformations. As a result, MTHFR testing has become an essential component of prenatal screening. This project is dedicated to developing faster, more cost-effective, and convenient diagnostic methods for folic acid testing and formulating personalized intervention plans for different populations. Through in-depth research on folic acid metabolism and related genes, we aim to reduce the incidence of birth defects associated with folic acid deficiency and safeguard maternal and child health.

5904	BohemiaBio	AleChemy	Beer is an important part of our culture, so we began our project by talking with brewers to understand their challenges. From these discussions, we learned that hops are essential mainly for providing bitterness. Guided by their feedback, we focused on reproducing this bitterness in yeast. Using untargeted metabolomics, we identified ?-acids as our target molecules for biosynthesis. Through iterative Design-Build-Test-Learn cycles, we introduced a construct into S. cerevisiae that enables the production of phlorisovalerophenone--the precursor of ?- and ?-acids--verified using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics. Our work was carried out in close contact with breweries, scientists, and the public to ensure responsible design and realistic applications. For the future, we plan to implement additional brewer-desired compounds such as xanthohumol and anthocyanins. Our project demonstrates how synthetic biology can merge innovation with brewing tradition by empowering yeast to produce hop-derived flavor precursors in an environmentally responsible way.

5905	RUM-UPRM	R-DetoX 2.0: Synthetic RDX-Induced Biodegradation Genetic Circuit in Escherichia coli within a Serial Bioreactor System	The island municipality of Puerto Rico, Vieques, remains contaminated from decades of military activity with the high-energy compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3, 5-triazine), posing severe risks to human health and local ecosystems. To address this issue, we engineered a genetic circuit in Escherichia coli for RDX biodegradation and biocontainment. The system integrates two modules: (1) a biodegradation module containing an RDX-inducible riboswitch that regulates xplA and xplB, encoding cytochrome P450 and its flavodoxin reductase responsible for degrading RDX into formaldehyde and nitrite, and (2) a killswitch module that detects these byproducts to trigger colicin-mediated cell lysis. The circuit will be implemented in a four-stage Serial Bioreactor System designed to promote bacterial growth, induce degradation, treat byproducts, and ensure safe environmental discharge. Our system provides a controlled and sustainable synthetic biology approach for mitigating RDX contamination and supporting environmental restoration in Vieques.

For knockdown, we cloned several Cas13b (bt1, bt3, pgu, Ran) and Cas13d (djCas13d) constructs into the xPERT backbone to test RNA cleavage efficiency using ANXA4 and BGALNT1 as the target. Guide RNAs were designed, cloned, and verified through restriction digestion, ligation, transformation, and sequencing. Confirmed plasmids will be transfected for RT-qPCR and editing assays to evaluate both knockdown and editing performance within a unified framework. On the computing side, we built a motif-guided protein generation model showing that conserved motifs reliably mark Cas13 subtypes. The first version (v1) used ESM-2 to generate realistic Cas13d variants that passed structural checks. A second version (v2) incorporated reinforcement learning for subtype precision but produced less natural sequences. v1 offers a practical baseline, while v2 points toward more controlled protein design.

However, current production is low, resulting in high market prices. Our solution is to improve astaxanthin production using Escherichia coli as a cellular factory. For astaxanthin synthesis, the astaxanthin synthesis pathway including seven genes were chosen and they were expressed in E. coli using two T7 promoters of the pET-Duet-1 vector. In addition, we modified ?-carotene hydroxylase using rational design, achieving four HpCrtZ mutants with high catalytic activities.Then we induced the expression by IPTG to synthesize astaxanthin in E. coli efficiently. Finally we obtained astaxanthin powder by freeze-drying, made astaxanthin-containing oil. For applications, we designed three target products including essence, face mask and opera makeup pigments. Our technology is mature, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable. We aim to meet the market demand for high quality astaxanthin through this approach.

In this project, we present a modular, quantitative engineering platform based on rationally modified HLA-A*02:01 molecules to improve tumor antigen visibility to T cells. We designed and built three heavy-chain constructs (wild type, single mutant W167A, and quadruple Tyr?Ala variant) plus a constant ?2-microglobulin part, all with biotinylation tags for tetramerization. Our approach combined in silico structural modeling (diffdock-guided residue selection) with wet-lab validation (SDS-PAGE, BCA quantification, ELISA binding assays). We demonstrated that engineered variants can meaningfully alter peptide binding affinity, confirmed through rigorous measurement pipelines. Alongside experimental work, we conducted public surveys and expert interviews to align our scientific goals with societal perceptions, developing educational modules to bridge knowledge gaps. This project integrates synthetic biology, immunology, measurement rigor, and human practices into a coherent toolkit for future MHC engineering.

In response, our team presented the concept of FoCas, a novel platform engineered to directly address the dual challenges of drug resistance and infectivity. FoCas leverages a two-component system: the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system for precise genetic targeting and cleavage, and a DNA origami nanostructure as a smart delivery and targeting vehicle. The DNA origami is programmed to recruit and protect the sgRNA/Cas9 complex, selectively bind to specific pathogen (e.g. MRSA), efficiently enter the cell with subsequent CRISPR-Cas9 activation to precisely cleaves and disables the gene responsible for antibiotic resistance (e.g. mecA). By combining precise genetic disruption with targeted delivery, FoCas may possess great potential as a candidate for future antimicrobial therapy, holding immense promise for dealing with superbug infections.

Firstly, to inhibit melanin production in the skin, we employed computer-aided methods to design a competitive peptide analog of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (?-MSH), which serves to block melanin synthesis. To delay skin aging and promote collagen synthesis, we incorporated segments that mimic growth factors into the fusion peptide sequence, which can stimulate skin cells to produce collagen. Additionally, we added a cell-penetrating peptide segment to the end of the fusion peptide to facilitate the entry of these compounds into skin cells for effective action. We utilize Escherichia coli DH5? for the production of these fusion peptides and have designed a microneedle-based delivery system to administer these compounds effectively.

5921	Tabor	Seawolves	Excessive nitrogen pollution from agricultural runoff, atmospheric deposition (which have increased because of fossil fuel), and other anthropologic activities have led to significant environmental challenges for the marine environment through eutrophication, the overflow of nutrients. Microorganisms reproduce rapidly in the presence of eutrophication to create HABs, or harmful algae blooms. These algae blooms can cover up to hundreds of kilometers, depriving the environment of oxygen and suffocating species into local extinction. Our review of existing nitrogen reduction methods suggests that they are of limited effectiveness. To address this problem, we formulated a solution to modify marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutumlum with a synthetic construct of pPha-T1 and NR gene, which increases the efficiency of nitrate degradation. By enhancing the ability of diatoms to process excess nitrogen, our approach seeks to reduce the nutrient load in marine environments and prevent the uncontrolled growth of harmful algal blooms.

5923	Shanghai-HS	Low-burden Dairy Products: Reduced lactose, lowered sugar and Increased fiber	Dairy products are essential for human health. Our project utilizes enzyme engineering and synthetic biology to express two recombinant enzymes: transgalactosidase and glucose oxidase. Transgalactosidase catalyzes the conversion of lactose into galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and glucose, whereas glucose oxidase converts glucose into gluconic acid. This process not only alleviates lactose intolerance symptoms but also reduces sugar content and enriches prebiotics in dairy products. Ultimately, it achieves lower carbohydrate intake and higher dietary fiber content, providing a healthier dairy option for consumers.

Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A), needing high-demand detection in medical aesthetics and food safety, prompts us to develop a simplified, accurate, fast, low-cost detection method to replace the traditional mouse bioassay. We use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to build a dual-yeast system: one acts as substrate to sense BoNT activity and release ligands, the other receives signals to express pigments for visualizing BoNT concentration, with coupled GPCR pathway and GAL system for signal amplification. It applies to quality inspection of medical aesthetic products and food safety, boosting efficiency and offering public accessible safety verification. This project can be applied in the quality inspection of medical aesthetic products and food safety testing. It not only improves the quality inspection efficiency of relevant institutions but also provides the general public with an accessible means to verify the safety of daily food products.

Conventional 2D cultures miss these behaviors, and animal models are slow, costly, and ethically constrained. We engineered NIH3T3 cells expressing control, NRAS^WT, or NRAS^G12D with an mCherry reporter for direct visualization and genotype validation. Using a PDMS lab-on-a-chip that mimics a bone-marrow-like matrix, we quantified growth (CCK-8) and migration (scratch wound healing vs on-chip Matrigel infiltration). NRAS^G12D accelerated wound closure and enhanced 3D invasion. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 produced mutation-dependent growth suppression, confirming pathway involvement.

5926	CUHK-Shenzhen	Glutamate-driven Ferroptosis Induction by Recombinant E.coli in tumor-specific environment	Current cancer therapies are limited by chemotherapy resistance, target mutations in precision drugs and severe side effects. As synthetic biology develops rapidly in recent decades, bacterial therapy has emerged as a promising alternative. Meanwhile, ferroptosis--a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation--has shown significant potential based on previous studies. Our study integrates bacterial therapy with ferroptosis induction by engineering Escherichia coli to overexpress glutamate specifically in tumor microenvironments. Glutamate can disrupt cellular redox homeostasis by depleting glutathione and accumulating lipid peroxides, thus selectively triggering ferroptosis in tumor cells, with colorectal cancer involved in this study. This approach combines synthetic biology with the potency of ferroptosis, aiming to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing off-target effects through microenvironment-responsive expression. We anticipate that it will provide new insights into bacterial cancer treatments, for innovative combination therapies that improve tumor targeting, reduce side effects, and achieve better clinical outcomes.

To quickly and safely test RNAi efficiency, we created an accessible yeast shRNA reporter platform through simple fluorescence readouts--ideal for student teams. Candidate shRNAs were filtered to minimize off-target effects, and in the yeast assay, twelve of fifteen shRNAs demonstrated active knockdown, presenting candidates for further implementation. Human Practices guided our project priority of reversible RNAi over gene editing, and we assessed delivery feasibility through modeling of siRNA activity and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) targeting.

Due to their polymeric structure, they show high affinity for Carbohydrate-Binding Modules (CBMs), domains found in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that normally bind polysaccharides. The effects of PET, LDPE, and PS microplastics are being studied in Drosophila melanogaster fed with microplastic-enriched food. A genetically modified Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 strain, engineered to display CBM on its surface using the Aga2p system, is added to the flies' food to test in vivo microplastic binding and excretion. Yeast viability is evaluated in a bioreactor simulating the large intestine, supporting its potential as a live therapeutic delivery system. Adsorption kinetics are modeled in an in silico intestinal environment, and molecular docking and machine learning (Pythia) are used to predict and optimize CBM-polymer interactions for future experimental validation.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) offers a biodegradable alternative, but its slow degradation and recycling limit its effectiveness. In Project PHoeBe, the Westview iGEM team investigates two newly identified enzymes, a PHB depolymerase and a dehydrogenase, found through metagenomic analysis, to improve PHB breakdown. Level 1 plasmids containing these genes were conjugated into knockout Alteromonas macleodii, and tests in a simulated ocean environment showed evidence of PHB degradation. Computational modeling also identified a potential catalytic triad in the depolymerase. Through outreach, we educated the public on plastic pollution, waste reduction, and the environmental promise of PHB.

While the dangers of first- and second-hand smoke are widely recognized, third-hand smoke--residual pollutants that settle on clothing, furniture, walls, and dust--remains an underappreciated health threat. Among its most hazardous constituents are tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), formed through the reaction of residual nicotine with airborne nitrite. TSNAs are strongly carcinogenic and highly resistant to degradation. To address this, we propose a dual-enzyme strategy: NicA, NicB, and NicC for the degradation of surface nicotine, and NirS, NorB, and NosZ for the removal of environmental nitrite. By preventing TSNA formation at the source, this biosafe and sustainable enzyme-based spray presents a novel synthetic biology approach to indoor environmental detoxification.

5944	Estonia-TUBI	Y.E.P. - Yeast Electron Production	To reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy storage is critical. Lithium-ion batteries dominate but pose environmental risks from mining, production, and disposal. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) offer a greener alternative: microorganisms oxidize organic waste, generating electricity while cleaning wastewater, providing sustained, low-carbon energy with fewer ecological impacts. In this project, we engineer yeast MFCs with enhanced electron storage and electron transfer capacity. We achieve that goal by elevating the Saccharomyces cerevisiae intracellular NADH pool and enhancing their extracellular electron transfer. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing tool, we deleted genes encoding the key enzymes of glycerol and ethanol biosynthesis, and external mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. Engineered strains were tested in custom MFC hardware. To fully leverage the increased intracellular NADH levels, we propose the heterologous expression of fungal cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) on the yeast cell surface to enhance the cell's ability to transfer electrons to electrodes.

5955	SaltLakeCommColl11	GlutaGuard: A Probiotic Shield Against Oxidative Stress	The project proposes using the commensal gut microbiome to enhance antioxidative defense through glutathione production. Glutathione, naturally produced in most mammalian cells and some bacteria, is essential for neutralizing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). However, chronic pollutant exposure can overwhelm this system, contributing to physical and psychological health issues. Three Lactobacillus strains (L. plantarum, L. reuteri, and L. rhamnosus) will be engineered to sense oxidative stress and produce glutathione to neutralize ROS/RNS. Transformation will use plasmids carrying an oxyR transcription factor, a trxC promoter, and a gshF gene. Modified colonies will be screened via ROS exposure assays to confirm plasmid uptake. Successfully modified strains may be delivered through probiotic foods such as yogurt or kombucha. By strengthening the gut's antioxidative capacity, this project aims to mitigate the adverse health effects of chronic air pollution exposure and improve overall resilience in both sensitive and general populations.

5962	KCL-UK	Latent Tuberculosis Diagnosis - Infecheck	One disease. Two billion lives affected. Tuberculosis (TB) remains humanity's most persistent infectious killer - and its hidden form, latent TB, can strike without warning. Yet current tests are slow, costly, and often out of reach for the communities hit hardest. Infecheck addresses the problem with early detection of LTB. We are developing a cheap, paper-strip diagnostic that uses a simple finger-prick blood sample to detect upregulated miRNAs specific to LTB. We explored two promising methods for exosomal miRNA detection: Toehold Switches and CCDR. We envision our end-product to be in the form of a lateral flow test and to use microfluidics as the extraction method. The test delivers easy-to-read results without requiring lab-based equipment. Our approach prevents the progression from latent to active TB, therefore reducing patient suffering and TB spread. INFECHECK - because we can't cure what we can't find.

5964	MPA-USA	Engineered EcN for Neoeriocitrin Production in Colorectal Cancer Therapy	Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising globally and increasingly affects people under 40. Current therapies are invasive and often cause severe side effects. We developed a precision therapeutic strategy using engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN). Neoeriocitrin, a natural flavonoid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities, shows promise in CRC prevention and adjuvant therapy but faces limitations of low yield and high extraction cost. To overcome this, we reconstructed its complete biosynthetic pathway in EcN by introducing VvRHM, UGT73B2, and Cm1,2RhaT, enabling efficient and controlled production. To ensure biosafety, we designed a dual suicide system: arabinose-inducible pBAD triggers in vivo lysis, while low-temperature-inducible pCspA provides environmental containment, both cooperating with MazF. This engineered probiotic integrates high-yield biosynthesis with strict biocontainment, offering a safe, controllable, and effective adjuvant strategy for CRC therapy, particularly for young patients with early-onset disease.

5970	SFLS-Shenzhen	Eucaplyn - Biosynthesis of 1,8-Cineole: A Sustainable Approach to Anti-Acne Skincare	Currently, the primary market applications of 1,8-cineole (Eucalyptol) are concentrated in perfumes, essential oils, and food processing. However, few have utilized 1,8-cineole for producing pharmaceuticals or skincare products. The key issue lies in the current bottleneck of purifying the component from plants (purity generally only reaches 80%-85%), coupled with the fact that the active component is highly prone to thermal decomposition, and traditional extraction processes are costly. In contrast, our production of 1,8-cineole using synthetic biology methods theoretically enables high purity, high efficiency, stable, and controllable production. This is precisely the key to addressing the pain points of traditional processes and enhancing product quality. Freed from the constraints of high cost and low purity, 1,8-cineole, leveraging its multi-target anti-acne capabilities including inhibiting Cutibacterium acnes, reducing inflammatory responses, and clearing excess sebum, holds promise as a novel anti-acne product superior to current single-mechanism options on the market.

Engineering a Systematic Pipeline for Site-Specific Lipid Functionalization of Enzymes	Protein therapeutics have transformed medicine but often suffer from rapid clearance. L-asparaginase, used to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, exemplifies this limitation. Conventional PEGylation extends its half-life but can trigger hypersensitivity and disrupt catalytic sites, highlighting the need for precise alternatives. Using genetically recoded E. coli and orthogonal translation systems, we incorporated nonstandard amino acids (nsAAs) enabling copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne click chemistry for site-specific fatty-acid conjugation. To identify tolerant positions, we combined sequence conservation analysis with Golden Gate-based construction of L-asparaginase variants and experimentally evaluated catalytic activity. Several nsAA incorporation sites preserved native bioactivity. These data trained a computational ensemble integrating molecular dynamics, docking, and stability metrics to predict functional outcomes of nsAA substitutions. This pipeline links experimental and computational protein engineering, reducing screening needs and improving therapeutic stability--offering a safer, longer-lasting alternative to PEGylation for more effective leukemia treatment.

5986	SR-China	Probabyotics Infant Formula: Probiotic HMOs, Digestible Casein & Lactose-Free	"To address critical limitations in current infant formula--specifically the absence of immunomodulatory human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), poor digestibility of casein micelles, and prevalent lactose intolerance--our team, Probabyotics, developed ""2-FLuxe"" using Escherichia coli Nissle 1917?EcN? as a probiotic chassis for integrated bioengineering. We constructed three synergistic systems: (1) a de novo 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) synthesis pathway (via manB-manC-gmd-fcl-futC overexpression) to produce breastmilk-mimetic HMOs at >80% reduced cost; (2) recombinant trypsinogen expression for precise casein hydrolysis, alleviating gastrointestinal burden; and (3) high-yield ?-galactosidase (lacZ) fermentation to eliminate lactose. Manufacturing involves EcN-based fermentation with low-cost substrates (glycerol/lactose), enzymatic purification, and incorporation of 2'-FL with trypsin/?-galactosidase-treated milk. The resulting formulation eliminates key drawbacks of conventional formulas by providing 2'-FL-driven pathogen inhibition and microbiota support, enhanced protein digestibility, and lactose-free tolerance--enabling accessible, breastmilk-equivalent nutrition for infants with digestive vulnerabilities or limited breastfeeding access."

Targeting the host-derived biomarker miR-155 - a key oncogenic miRNA upregulated in precancerous lesions--the system employs a modular toehold switch probe that undergoes conformational change upon target binding, activating a T7 promoter to transcribe sgRNA. This triggers Cas13a-mediated cis-cleavage of target RNA and collateral trans-cleavage of fluorescent reporters, enabling pM-level detection under isothermal conditions (37 ?). Validated via rigorous DBTL (Design-Build-Test-Learn) cycles, the biosensor achieves single-base specificity and pM sensitivity, overcoming limitations of traditional HPV-DNA assays (e.g., inability to distinguish transient vs. oncogenic infections). Encapsulated in the user-friendly ""CerviSure Scanner"" - a 3D-printed, disposable microfluidic device - the system supports decentralized, non-invasive screening with rapid results (<60 min). This platform promises to reduce healthcare disparities by enabling accessible, high-accuracy screening in low-resource settings, advancing global cervical cancer elimination efforts."

Salidroside, a cardioprotective compound from Rhodiola rosea, shows antioxidant and anti-hypoxic effects but is difficult to source sustainably. To solve this, we engineered Escherichia coli to biosynthesize salidroside via an optimized tyrosol pathway and heterologous expression of a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT). In addition, we developed a whole-cell biosensor targeting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP), a key intermediate in the microbial biosynthetic pathway of salidroside. By employing this sensor, we enhanced salidroside production through directed evolution. Our system provides an eco-friendly, scalable alternative to plant extraction, reducing pressure on fragile plateau ecosystems while supporting youth heart health through synthetic biology innovation.

Current treatment relies on invasive surgery. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme, neutralizes reactive oxygen species but suffers from instability and rapid degradation, limiting its therapeutic potential. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is an important subtype of the SOD family. This enzyme is closely related to the occurrence and development of cataracts. Our project employs computational biology and machine learning to engineer thermostable, high-activity Mn-SOD variants. These variants will be characterized in E. coli. Furthermore, a multi-scale mathematical model will be developed to simulate the spatiotemporal efficacy of Mn-SOD when delivered as an eye drop, from catalytic kinetics to reaction-diffusion within the eye. The goal is to develop engineered Mn-SOD as a core component of novel eye drops, offering a non-invasive strategy for cataract prevention and early intervention to alleviate the global disease burden.

5993	AGORA-KOR	Protective effect of ginseng on bioaccessibility and oxidative stress induced by microplastics during in-vitro digestion	This study investigated how Korean ginseng affects amine-functionalized polystyrene microplastics (MPs) using a simulated digestion model and liver cell cultures. Researchers found that ginsenosides, the active compounds in ginseng, promote the aggregation of MPs through electrostatic interactions. This clumping effect significantly reduced the bioaccessibility of the microplastics, with a 1:4 (MP:ginseng) ratio lowering it to just 6.52%. Dynamic light scattering and microscopy confirmed that a 1:2 ratio induced the greatest aggregation. Hyperspectral imaging showed a strong binding between ginsenosides and MPs. Critically, when human liver (HepG2) cells were exposed to MPs, co-treatment with ginseng significantly lowered the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). The findings suggest that ginseng can mitigate the potential harm of microplastics by decreasing their absorption in the gut and protecting hepatic cells from oxidative stress.

6009	QYZX-China	VitaPop Jelly: A Probiotic Platform for GLP-1 Delivery in Glucose Regulation	According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 589 million adults worldwide have diabetes, with Type 2 diabetes comprising over 90% of cases. Persistent hyperglycemia can lead to serious multi-organ complications. Current treatments require frequent administration, creating practical burdens and reducing quality of life. Our project, VitaPop Jelly, addresses this through an innovative solution: using engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 to enable continuous intestinal secretion of GLP-1 for sustained glycemic control. We optimized the GLP-1 codon usage to enhance expression and implemented a dual biocontainment system using cysteine auxotrophy and a temperature-sensitive promoter to prevent transgenic leakage. We aim to provide people with diabetes with a safer, more convenient biologic treatment option that improves both health outcomes and daily life.

6011	HPI-Potsdam	BioComplete: AI-Powered DNA Design Assistant	AI models are transforming biology by capturing complex patterns in DNA sequences. However, realizing their full potential requires both high-quality training data and user-friendly tools for scientists. The iGEM Registry contains the largest collection of synthetic biology parts, but inconsistent annotations and limited search functionality make it difficult to use directly for AI training or for everyday part discovery. Our project addresses these challenges by adapting a DNA foundation model, Evo2, to genetic circuit design. We develop representations that capture functional similarity between parts, enabling reliable retrieval and AI-guided part suggestions. To support this process, we developed a sequence-centric data model that provides easily accessible, findable metadata, including safety status. Our sequence editor and search engine makes the model's capabilities available to users at https://biocomplete.it/. Together, these components form a cycle: cleaner data improves the model, the model creates meaningful embeddings, and these embeddings power new tools for synthetic biology.

6012	MUST-Macau	NanosphinX	Our project began with bioinformatic analysis and flow cytometry experiments, which revealed that breast and pancreatic cancers frequently exhibit upregulation of both CD47 and HER2 receptors. To address this challenge, we designed a bispecific fusion protein incorporating an active antibody fragment targeting HER2 and a nanobody targeting CD47. These designed fragments, along with those retrieved from existing databases, formed a library of candidate antibody fragments. The most stable fragments with the lowest binding free energy were selected for the assembly of the active bispecific antibody, NanosphinX. Two assembly strategies were tested to link the two selected active antibody fragments into the final bispecific format. Cell viability assays demonstrated that NanosphinX exhibits cytotoxic effects against wild-type breast cancer cells and maintains strong activity even in trastuzumab-resistant cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth. It also enhanced the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine in gemcitabine-resistant cell lines, providing a rational basis for combination therapy with gemcitabine.

6013	DelNorte-SD	Dermalogic - Dual Plasmid Biosensor + Response System to Mitigate Inflammation	Skin inflammation, like in acne, is driven by immune signals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide, which amplify irritation and tissue damage. Our therapeutic molecule, Indole-3-acetic-acid (IAA), a plant auxin, has anti-inflammatory benefits by blocking NF-?B signaling and neutralizing reactive oxygen species. Our project is focusing on designing a dual-plasmid biosensor system built as a biological AND gate to detect these cues. The system requires two concurrent inputs: NO detection (via the NorR/PnorV? promoter to produce LuxR) and H2?O2? detection (via OxyR/PoxyS? to activate 3OC6HSL). Only when both LuxR and 3OC6HSL are present will they combine to activate the Plux? promoter, driving downstream gene expression of indole-3-acetic-acid.

By combining dCas9-VP64, rtTA, and sgRNAs within a modular delivery framework, we sought to create a tunable gene expression platform that could be rapidly activated through Doxycycline induction. Preliminary results have shown minimal to no detectable protein expression across varying Doxycycline concentrations and induction times. Moreover, the system's capacity to induce downstream gene activation via independent or co-delivered sgRNAs remains uncharacterized. Despite these challenges, our work establishes an important foundation for refining inducible CRISPRa systems and contributes valuable insights toward achieving safe, controllable antiviral gene therapy.

6015	WLSA-ShanghaiAcademy	LEGO: Light-induced Expression of GLP-1 and insulin for Obesity and diabetes treatment	The global epidemics of type 2 diabetes and obesity demand innovative, long-term solutions beyond traditional invasive and single-target therapies. We developed LEGO (Light-induced Expression of GLP-1 and Insulin), an optogenetic gene therapy platform that enables precise, reversible, and non-invasive control of dual-hormone secretion. Leveraging endogenous bioluminescence or a wireless light source, LEGO regulates the co-expression of insulin and bioactive GLP-1(7-37)--a clinically validated combination for managing hyperglycemia and obesity. Activation is achieved via oral administration of a luciferase substrate or through a wearable light device, eliminating the need for repeated injections. To enable personalized treatment, we created an open-source software-hardware package that converts patient data (e.g., glucose levels, weight, meal information) into programmable light stimulation for optimized hormone release. Designed with future implantable use in mind, LEGO offers a smart, patient-friendly, and sustainable therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease management.

We present a low-cost detection toolkit that converts BPA binding into a visible reporter using a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) design. The estrogen receptor-? (ER?/ESR1) ligand-binding domain is fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (pGilda) and the B42 activation domain (pB42AD); ligand-induced ER? dimerization juxtaposes BD and AD, activating yeast reporters. To boost sensitivity to BPA's weak agonism, we engineered mutations in the ER? LBD (residues ~519-535) by splicing-by-overlap-extension PCR and cloned variants into pGILDA (bait) and pB42AD (prey). We will evaluate wild-type and mutant ESR1 by dose-response ?-galactosidase assays with positive/negative controls and selectivity tests, as a foundation for future community kits."

An engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) biosensor uses a tetracycline-responsive tet promoter linked to a reporter gene, enabling visual, semi-quantitative detection directly in environmental samples. To ensure biosafety, TCsensor incorporates a robust triple-induction lysis system (temperature-sensitive, L-arabinose-inducible, and lactose-inducible), enabling precise engineered cell self-destruction upon application of specific external signals post-detection, thereby preventing environmental release.

The key innovation is the first light-controlled system for targeted pain management using engineered bacteria, integrating the NETMAP system with PaurTx-3 for precise spatiotemporal control. Experimental results show Gibson Assembly achieved 65% efficiency (vs. <10% for traditional PCR cloning), but PaurTx-3 solubility was only 15% (85% formed inclusion bodies). Hydrogel encapsulation maintained >80% bacterial viability and light-responsive expression. The critical challenge is PaurTx-3 low solubility, addressed by implementing a SUMO fusion tag. The project features multiple safety mechanisms including self-destruct systems and gene blockade, complying with FDA/EMA/WHO standards. Future work includes in vivo testing to develop a non-addictive pain management solution for cancer and burn patients.

The $900 billion industry is increasingly flooded with counterfeit products containing toxic ingredients like hydroquinone, a banned skin-lightening agent in the U.S., U.K., and EU. Despite its whitening effect, hydroquinone causes oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, ochronosis, and even cancer risk. Yet in much of Asia and Africa, it remains freely sold in unregulated ""brightening"" creams, exploiting beauty insecurities and endangering lives. Beyond public health, counterfeit cosmetics cause massive economic losses to legitimate brands. Existing detection methods are expensive and limited to specialized labs. To address this, we developed a HEK293T cell-based biosensor using the Nrf2-ARE pathway to sense oxidative stress and activate an EGFP reporter, producing a visible signal when exposed to hydroquinone.

6026	IIT-ROORKEE	AMPlify	This project addresses antimicrobial resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis through the in silico design of a novel therapeutic combining lytic mycobacteriophage D29 with a computationally engineered antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Using an AI-driven pipeline, over 40 candidate peptides were generated and screened via machine learning for high antimycobacterial activity and low host toxicity. Initial targets of intracellular proteins were abandoned after molecular dynamics simulations showed poor peptide stability. The focus shifted to designing membrane-active AMPs with enhanced structural robustness. Final simulations confirmed the lead AMP's stability in solution and its ability to disrupt a model bacterial membrane. This AMP was then conceptually integrated into a donor cassette for insertion into the D29 genome. The result is a synthesis-ready, computationally validated blueprint for a therapeutic phage, with a clear plan for experimental validation in Mycobacterium smegmatis* a safe surrogate host. This work lays the foundation for a novel, precision-engineered biotherapeutic against drug-resistant tuberculosis.

6031	CalUCSF	NeuroSplice: Low-Cost RNA Diagnostic Tool for Multiple Sclerosis	Multiple sclerosis (MS) lacks a rapid and affordable molecular screening tool, with diagnosis currently dependent on MRI and invasive CSF analysis. A key genetic risk factor involves exon-6 skipping in the interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R) gene, producing a soluble isoform (sIL7R) associated with immune activation and MS susceptibility. To address this gap, we developed NeuroSplice, a cell-free toehold-switch diagnostic platform that detects the IL7R ?6 splice junction with high specificity. In the OFF state, the switch sequesters the RBS and start codon within a hairpin structure. The binding of the cognate RNA trigger unwinds the hairpin and activates GFP translation. Using an in-silico pipeline (NUPACK, RNAstructure, BLAST) alongside iterative design-build-test-learn cycles in TXTL assays, we optimized sequence context and incorporated sfGFP to reduce background expression and achieve strong ON/OFF discrimination in 12-µL reactions. Freeze-dry compatibility makes NeuroSplice portable, offering potential for triage in resource-limited settings, longitudinal monitoring, and therapeutic response tracking.

6033	IITKharagpur	TRACER: Targeted Relapse Assessment via Cellular Effector Response	TRACER is a tunable cell-based sensor that detects CD19 and reports only when the signal is strong. Its core is a SynNotch receptor that, upon CD19 engagement, releases a transcription factor to activate a reporter. An intracellular inhibitor binds the transcription factor and blocks promoter access until its concentration surpasses a preset buffer, creating a built-in threshold that filters weak signals. Using a design-build-test-learn loop, we optimized promoter strength, DNA ratios, and inhibitor dose. Dry-lab models predicted SynNotch cleavage, inhibitor binding, and reporter output, guiding mid-range expression for stable control. Wet-lab assays in HEK293T cells confirmed contact-dependent activation and graded suppression with increasing inhibitor copy number. Fixing SynNotch:Reporter at 1:10 lowered baseline, and titrating the EF1?-driven inhibitor shifted activation predictably. TRACER enables adjustable sensitivity without redesigning the receptor, offering a compact, modular platform for robust CD19 detection adaptable to other outputs and formats.

6034	BBS-Kuwait	Sandure	Kuwait's extreme heat, scarce rainfall, and sandy soil composition contribute to rapid water loss and reduced agricultural productivity. To address this environmental challenge, this project proposes engineering Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 to enhance soil water retention through the controlled production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). By co-transforming the strain with plasmids pVanCC (Amp^R) and pAcu (Kan^R), the bacteria can be designed to express EPS under specific induction conditions, such as elevated temperatures. The produced EPS would act as a natural hydrogel, improving the soil's ability to retain moisture and reduce evaporation in arid environments. When applied to Kuwaiti soil, the modified bacteria are expected to create a microenvironment that binds water and stabilizes soil particles. This theoretical approach highlights the potential of synthetic biology to provide a bio-based, sustainable solution for water conservation and agricultural resilience in Kuwait's desert ecosystems.

Though effective at weight management, semaglutide has several adverse gastrointestinal side effects, ranging from mild nausea and diarrhea to severe damage to the kidneys and pancreas. Semaglutide's injectable synthetic form and extended systemic half-life make it difficult for patients to access and tolerate this medication. In response, Fleur was designed as an orally delivered engineered probiotic that can express and secrete wild-type GLP-1 within the human gastrointestinal tract. By using components of the body's own gut microbiome and avoiding synthetic products, we hope to reduce systemic exposure to semaglutide and lower the risk of adverse events, while making a product that more sustainably controls T2DM symptoms and provides a comfortable and affordable alternative to injectable products.
